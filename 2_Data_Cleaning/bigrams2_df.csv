charter fintech,https://www.bobsguide.com/guide/news/2020/Aug/21/us-fintechs-could-look-seriously-at-banking-charters-amidst-occ-uncertainty/,7,"['US fintechs could look “seriously” at banking charters amidst OCC uncertainty', '\r\n\r\nThe issuance of a banking charter to digital bank Varo this month could inspire US fintechs to reconsider their strategies, according to Michael Breslin, partner and Fintech Industry Team chair, Kilpatrick Townsend and Stockton LLP.\r\n\r\n“I do think that we’re going to start seeing more charters issued to entities like Varo and if the [Federal Reserve] can monitor them properly and they want to accept the testing requirements that the federal government will put on them, that is probably where we’re going to start seeing things go. We’re on the cusp of seeing what is going to be the impact of that,” says Breslin.\r\n\r\nOn August 13, the OCC defended its special purpose national bank (SPNB) charter, also known as the fintech charter, before the Second Circuit, following a challenge by New York’s Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). The appeal follows 2018’s Lacewell v. OCC trial, which concluded that the OCC did not have the authority to grant National Bank Act charters to nondepository institutions.\r\n\r\n“One of the reasons you’re not seeing a lot of applications for the SPNB [charter] is because of this cloud of litigation that’s over it. Why should companies put all this effort into filling out the application, going through hiring lawyers to put all this stuff together, if we don’t even know if this is going to be a valid thing? It could be all for not,” says Breslin.\r\n\r\nAccording to Jeffrey Naimon, partner, Buckley LLP, Varo’s decision take on a full purpose charter may signal a shift in the industry.\r\n\r\n“It is unclear whether the issuance of this charter for Varo is going to be the new path,” he says.\r\n\r\n“The long timeframe makes it difficult for [the fintech charter] to be a saviour, but on the other hand the prospect of having one charter is so attractive … I think we’ll continue to see successful fintech companies look very seriously at either getting a full purpose charter like Varo did, or applying for the fintech charter if they really can’t see themselves using the full charter.”\r\n\r\nThe ongoing litigation follows a persistent wave of state backlash over regulatory jurisdiction and the changing business of banking. The NYDFS’s position is that deposit taking is integral to banking, a tenet that would be changed fundamentally by the fintech charter.\r\n\r\n“Until the litigation concern is wrapped up and addressed one way or the other, it’s going to be difficult for a fintech to put millions of dollars and management resources into pursuing a charter that it’s not sure it will ever use,” says Naimon.\r\n\r\n“Even then, it’s going to sign up for a multi-year process of getting a charter – it’s a slow process because bank regulators are very careful in how they vet applicants for a bank charter.”\r\n\r\nFintech’s future in the US\r\n\r\nIf the current appeal goes on the thwart the fintech charter, Naimon believes the US will become a more hostile environment for fintechs.\r\n\r\n“We have fewer fintechs per capita here than in the UK because we have such a difficult, fragmented regulatory environment,” he says, referencing long-standing difficulties between state-level and federal regulators.\r\n\r\nBut some believe the US could still be lucrative.\r\n\r\n“The States continue to be an attractive place for fintechs,” says Breslin.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think the outcome of this lawsuit will make the States less attractive, I just think it’s going to either solidify the regulatory landscape in a way that could make it easier for certain types of fintechs to operate the way they want. But at the same time, all of these companies are unique, so some may not care,” he says.\r\n\r\nDespite uncertainty, Breslin points out that OCC continues to take a strong pro-fintech position that breeds encouragement. In May, the regulator announced plans for a special purpose payments charter for payment companies.\r\n\r\n“They announced the payments charter while the fintech charter lawsuit is pending … even while the case is pending and who knows how it’s going to come out, the OCC is continuing to try to find alternate ways to make the States a more welcoming, more consistent, unified regulatory landscape for companies that are going to operate across the country,” says Breslin.\r\n\r\nAccording to Naimon, the US regulatory structure will need to change in order to keep up with tech innovation.\r\n\r\n“The technology is moving and the consumers are moving, so the bank regulatory structure will have to react to that or it will lose out. It’s not about the OCC doing this crazy new thing; it’s that they absolutely need to keep pace because customers aren’t going to be waiting around,” he says.\r\n']"

concerned fintech,https://www.bobsguide.com/guide/news/2020/Oct/9/financial-services-should-be-worried-about-big-tech-not-fintech/,2,"['Financial services should be worried about big tech not fintech', '\r\n\r\nSpeaking on a Sibos 2020 panel, Michael King, Lansdowne chair in finance at the Gustavson School of Business at the University of Victoria said big techs will be more a threat to traditional financial service players than fintechs were six years ago.\r\n\r\n“Rather than being threatened by fintech start-ups, which was the initial hypothesis and story being put up by the media. Our conclusion is that banks will be more threatened by large technology companies like Chinese techfins such as Alibaba and Tencent. And the big tech companies in North America, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.”\r\n\r\n“These tech companies have the platform ecosystems that embed financial services, including payments, lending, investing and insurance. We believe these tech fins and big tech players will prove to be the real threats to incumbents over the next decade.”\r\nTheir other prediction is that there will be more cooperation between financial services and fintechs.\r\n\r\n“The most successful incumbents will partner with FinTech start-ups to provide better experience to their customers at a lower cost,” said Richard Nesbitt, professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.\r\n\r\nKing said that cooperation between the two has been spurred by the fact that for the most part, financial tech and service providers are not competing for the same market.\r\n\r\n“[Fintechs] are building a foothold at the low end of the market targeting underserved customers, particularly millennials, whose expectations for customer experiences had been really changed and heightened by nonfinancial companies like Apple and Google.”\r\n\r\nJesse McWaters, global head of digital policy at Mastercard said that in 2014 most bank executives were skeptical of fintechs. Specifically, their ability to build consumer trust, to scale and for the new players to meet the regulatory requirements in the finance sector especially after the 2008 financial crisis.\r\n\r\nHowever, when he reconveyed a meeting a year later, he said the executives’ perspective changed remarkably.\r\n\r\n“When we brought that group together, only a year later in January of 2015, they had shifted from this, ‘complacency’, though not universally, to a palpable anxiety. That they were in for a serious fight, that they were going to need to be changes in the way that they ran their business. We\'ve seen over the last five years, the results of that.""\r\n\r\nFor the most part, financial service providers opted to collaborate with fintechs rather than compete with them.\r\n\r\nMcwaters gave the example of robo-advisors, which were brought into the mainstream by fintechs like Betterment and Wealthfront. It was however traditional financial services that were better able to fully utilise this new technology.\r\n\r\n“Ultimately, it hasn\'t been Wealthfront or Betterment, who have been most successful at scaling up this model. It\'s been the BlackRock or the Charles Schwabs’ of the world, the old guard who have taken those innovations, adopted and internalised them. They have used the existing capabilities that they have in terms of sales force and of pre-existing client relationships, to really drive those models up to full scale.""']"

created fintech,https://www.bobsguide.com/guide/news/2020/Dec/4/the-complexities-of-creating-fintech-and-how-to-overcome-them/,2,"['The complexities of creating fintech and how to overcome them', '\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest changes to come from the coronavirus pandemic is the effect it’s had on consumers’ expectations. The increased reliance on digital solutions has, in turn, opened people’s eyes to the convenience (or inconvenience) of managing their financial affairs online.\r\n\r\nYobota recently commissioned a survey of over 2,000 UK adults to explore how satisfied customers are with their banks in 2020. The majority (58 percent) said they want more power to renegotiate or change their accounts or products, with a third (33 percent) expressing frustrations at having to choose from generic, off-the-shelf financial products.\r\n\r\nDemand for greater control and more flexible, personalised products is on the rise. These demands can be met, but only if financial institutions and technology vendors are progressive in the development and application of fintech.\r\n\r\nWhether banks build it or buy it, there is a fundamental need to understand how fintech is created. And, moreover, how to do it well.\r\n\r\nAddressing the regulation barrier\r\n\r\nFinance, and by extension fintech, is a heavily regulated industry. A fintech creator’s ability to navigate the regulatory landscape and ensure it remains compliant with all the necessary checks is key to winning the confidence of the public, as well as potential clients and partners.\r\n\r\nOften, a huge volume of work is required. Rules can change over time (even temporarily, as we have seen in some cases this year), and there’s always room for interpretation in the principle-based regulatory approach.\r\n\r\nHaving a team of compliance experts on board is crucial to effectively handle any regulatory demands, particularly as the business scales – both in terms of its user base, and as it crosses borders into new regulatory environments.\r\n\r\nBusinesses must always remain forthcoming and transparent about the steps they are taking to protect the consumer, and consequently the reputation of their business partner(s).\r\n\r\nWhat problem are you solving, and who are you solving it for?\r\n\r\nIt is easy to overlook the basics when you set out to bring a new product to market and instead get bogged down in developing features. I would encourage vendors to take a step back and consider the bigger picture before delving into the technical aspects of product development.\r\n\r\nWhat challenge are you going to solve first? Is it an issue related to payment infrastructure, insurance, or investment management? Fintech is an incredibly broad industry, so it’s important to be clear on your goals. Are you going to improve or replace something that already exists, or are you looking to bring something entirely new to the market? These are all questions that should be asked in the very initial stages of development.\r\n\r\nFeatures are important, but they are often a secondary reason a customer will buy or use a product. So, it’s important that your offering provides a valuable solution to a very specific problem before worrying about the finer details.\r\n\r\nTo that end, knowing your client is crucial. Product and engineering teams need to have a clear focus as to their end goal and have a strong understanding of who they are building the product for.\r\n\r\nA technology vendor must be specific and strategic when it comes to pursuing the right clients (a particular type of financial services firm, for instance), while also keeping in mind the cultural fit between their team and prospective partners. Ensuring there is a mutual understanding of what the overall vision is and how it will be achieved – including the practical implementation, timeline and costs – will establish a strong foundation for the business-to-business relationship.\r\n\r\nAligning the best technology with best practice\r\n\r\nMeaningful digital transformation is achieved when the best technology aligns with best practice. Developers must resist the urge to jump on the latest technology trends, which might, at best, increase the cost of development or, at worst, significantly set back progress.\r\n\r\nEffective innovation ultimately comes from creating a stronger value proposition for clients. If exciting new architectures or programming languages don’t achieve this, then it is best to leave them out of the equation.\r\n\r\nFintech needs to be created in modern ways, with proven foundational principles in mind. Engineers must be certain their product will remain relevant and valuable for years to come, even if they are no longer there to support it.\r\n\r\nThe end user is key\r\n\r\nThe coronavirus pandemic has made it patently clear that the most successful finance companies are those that have formed partnerships to create technology which can be used seamlessly between separate banking products and accounts. Yobota’s aforementioned research is evidence of that; banking customers are becoming increasingly frustrated with inflexible products and services.\r\n\r\nThe quality and functionality of digital solutions is going to remain of utmost importance going forward. Once people have a taste for the speed, ease and convenience of being able to manage their finance affairs digitally, they will not settle for a return to in-branch meetings, lengthy telephone calls or slow exchanges of paperwork.\r\n\r\nThat is why the voice of the customer must always drive development roadmaps. After all, the happiness of the end user is the strongest indication of success.\r\n\r\nFintechs must consider how they can deftly leverage new and advancing technology to continue to make the customer experience even better, while also improving their underlying product. Interoperability – the ease of integration with other providers – is also an important consideration to bear in mind.\r\n\r\nProgressive fintech promotes partnerships and interoperability to reduce the roadblocks that customers encounter – and it will find innovative ways to bring all of these services into one product.\r\n\r\nThe success of finance companies in the months ahead will, in no small part, be determined by their ability to keep pace with the technological change that is taking place. There is no doubt that developing fintech solutions that are fit for purpose in today’s market is a tall order, but the reward comes from seeing the difference it makes to businesses’ and consumers’ everyday']"

deploy fintech,https://finscend.com/why-banks-will-have-to-deploy-fintech-solutions/,4,"['Why Banks Will Have to Deploy Fintech Solutions It used to be something that wasn’t mentioned in polite company, but those days are now over. Bank technology, especially the technology used to process credit card disputes, is outdated. It hasn’t been substantially upgraded for decades. And both banks and bank customers are suffering because of it. There are five major reasons why outdated banking technology has become a drag on traditional banks. First and foremost, perhaps, is the emergence of digital banking and challenger banks. These online alternatives are proving to be extremely popular with Millennials and Generation Z – whose business the veteran financial institutions will eventually have to attract in order to remain viable in the long run. Millennials and Gen Z, of course, are especially tech-savvy. Millennials were the first generation to have had internet access while in grammar school, and Gen Z is the first demographic to have been born after the invention of the smartphone. They are acculturated to do everything online on their pocket devices, and every study confirms, therefore, that they seek out alternatives to traditional businesses that require their physical presence at a particular location, especially when they have to wait before being able to get their business done. That’s bad news for big banks, since it’s typical for big banks. True, banks are culturally conservative. They don’t change long-established on a whim, especially technology. After all, millions and millions of files will have to migrate seamlessly from one platform to another. There is no room for failure. Which is why all big banks everywhere are now busy planning their all-digital future. The second reason is that fiat currency now faces competition from digital currencies. Unlike old-fashioned cash, cryptocurrency is acquired, held, traded, and spent outside of the traditional banking infrastructure. Combine that with the low percentage of Millennials and Gen Z who currently hold credit cards and their natural tendency to gravitate to digital solutions and banks face a major challenge. The planned launch of Libra, Facebook’s own cryptocurrency, will only intensify the competition. The third reason is alternative payment systems. And not just PayPal, the highly touted ApplePay and, of course, Amazon Payments and Google Wallet, but also Payoneer, Payza and Skrill, among others. These are user-friendly solutions for anyone with a smartphone, and not just Millennials and Gen Z. The fourth reason is that outdated technology is quickly becoming unaffordable. In comparison with other industries, which take advantage of new technological advances to increase automation and reduce operating expenses, the financial sector has slipped far behind. Ever-increasing operating expenses compromise the profitability of traditional banks in an increasingly competitive environment. Bank executives know that, and so do industry analysts who now address it in their reports. According to McKinsey, for example, the 15 largest American banks waste $3 billion annually on credit card dispute processing, which results from deficiencies in standardization, knowledge and software, not to mention substandard customer service. All of this brings us to the fifth and final reason why banks will have to grapple with their archaic technology and methodology: Fintech solutions are now reaching maturity. Banks are naturally cautious about making changes to their existing digital systems. But fintech incorporates new approaches – like artificial intelligence – that banks will be obliged to deploy to enable them to leapfrog ahead and thus compete and remain profitable in the long run. The World FinTech Report 2018, prepared by Capgemini and LinkedIn in cooperation with Efma, sums it up cogently: “Traditional financial institutions have a vast customer base and deep pockets, but with legacy systems holding them back.” Fintech will ensure that banks will no longer have to worry about that.

What impact might fintech have on financial services, and how should regulation respond? This paper sets out an economic framework for thinking through the channels by which fintech might provide solutions that respond to consumer needs for trust, security, privacy, and better services, change the competitive landscape, and affect regulation. It combines a broad discussion of trends across financial services with a focus on cross-border payments and especially the impact of distributed ledger technology. Overall, the paper finds that boundaries among different types of service providers are blurring; barriers to entry are changing; and improvements in cross-border payments are likely. It argues that regulatory authorities need to balance carefully efficiency and stability trade-offs in the face of rapid changes, and ensure that trust is maintained in an evolving financial system. It also highlights the importance of international cooperation.', 'Fintech,cross border payments,market structure,financial regulation,financial stability,monetary policy,virtual currencies,digital currencies,competition,entry,intermediaries,concentration,market contestability,vertical integration,horizontal integration,product differentiation,network externalities,economies of scale,barriers to entry,sunk costs,fixed costs,information asymmetries,transaction costs,matching,innovation,adoption,cross-border payments,General,Government Policy and Regulation,Government Policy and Regulation']"

The first generation was paper-based. Delivery times for payment instruments took several days domestically and weeks internationally. The second generation involved computerization with batch processing. Links between payment systems were made through manual or file-based interfaces. The change-over period between technologies was long and still some paper-based instruments like checks and cash remain in use. The third generation, which has been emerging, involves electronic and mobile payment schemes that enable integrated, immediate, and end-to-end payment and settlement transfers. For example, real-time gross settlement  systems have been available in almost all countries. DLT has been viewed as a potential platform for the next generation of payment systems, enhancing the integration and the reconciliation of settlement accounts and their ledgers. So far, experiments with DLT experimentations point to the potential for financial infrastructures to move towards real-time settlement, flatter structures, continuous operations, and global reach. Testing in large-value payments and securities settlement systems have partly demonstrated the technical feasibility of DLT for this new environment. The projects examined analyzed issues associated with operational capacity, resiliency, liquidity savings, settlement finality, and privacy. DLT-based solutions can also facilitate delivery versus payment of securities, payment versus payment of foreign exchange transactions, and efficient cross-border payments.', 'fintech,distributed ledger technology,payments and settlements,large value payment systems,securities settlement systems,cross-border payments,liquidity risks,credit risks,delayed transactions,settlement finality,counterparty risks,stability,bank run risk,short selling,short buying,financial market infrastructure standards,FTN,settlement system,DLT,RTGS,ledger,finality']"

But fintech activity is growing rapidly. Digital payment schemes are expanding within countries, although cross-border and pan-euro area instruments are not yet widespread, notwithstanding important enabling EU level regulation and the establishment of instant payments by the ECB. Automated lending models are developing but remain limited mainly to unsecured consumer lending. While start-ups are pursuing platform-based approaches under minimal regulation, there is a clear trend for fintech companies to acquire balance sheets and, relatedly, banking licenses as they expand. Meanwhile, competition is pushing many traditional banks to adopt fintech instruments, either in-house or by acquisition, thereby causing them to increasingly resemble balanced sheet-based fintech companies. These developments could improve the efficiency and reach of financial intermediation while also adding to profitability pressures for some banks. Although the COVID-19 pandemic could call into question the viability of platform-based lending fintechs funding models given that investors could face much higher  delinquencies, it may also offer growth opportunities to those fintechs that are positioned to take advantage of the ongoing structural shift in demand toward virtual finance.', 'lending,payment system,European Union,Payments Directive,PSD2,WP,Fintech company,direct debit,micro-enterprise lending,individual investor,Big-tech company,crowdfunding firm,due diligence,payment company,value chain,venture capital']"

heavily fintech,https://www.bobsguide.com/guide/news/2020/Dec/4/the-complexities-of-creating-fintech-and-how-to-overcome-them/,5,"['The complexities of creating fintech and how to overcome them', '\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest changes to come from the coronavirus pandemic is the effect it’s had on consumers’ expectations. The increased reliance on digital solutions has, in turn, opened people’s eyes to the convenience (or inconvenience) of managing their financial affairs online.\r\n\r\nYobota recently commissioned a survey of over 2,000 UK adults to explore how satisfied customers are with their banks in 2020. The majority (58 percent) said they want more power to renegotiate or change their accounts or products, with a third (33 percent) expressing frustrations at having to choose from generic, off-the-shelf financial products.\r\n\r\nDemand for greater control and more flexible, personalised products is on the rise. These demands can be met, but only if financial institutions and technology vendors are progressive in the development and application of fintech.\r\n\r\nWhether banks build it or buy it, there is a fundamental need to understand how fintech is created. And, moreover, how to do it well.\r\n\r\nAddressing the regulation barrier\r\n\r\nFinance, and by extension fintech, is a heavily regulated industry. A fintech creator’s ability to navigate the regulatory landscape and ensure it remains compliant with all the necessary checks is key to winning the confidence of the public, as well as potential clients and partners.\r\n\r\nOften, a huge volume of work is required. Rules can change over time (even temporarily, as we have seen in some cases this year), and there’s always room for interpretation in the principle-based regulatory approach.\r\n\r\nHaving a team of compliance experts on board is crucial to effectively handle any regulatory demands, particularly as the business scales – both in terms of its user base, and as it crosses borders into new regulatory environments.\r\n\r\nBusinesses must always remain forthcoming and transparent about the steps they are taking to protect the consumer, and consequently the reputation of their business partner(s).\r\n\r\nWhat problem are you solving, and who are you solving it for?\r\n\r\nIt is easy to overlook the basics when you set out to bring a new product to market and instead get bogged down in developing features. I would encourage vendors to take a step back and consider the bigger picture before delving into the technical aspects of product development.\r\n\r\nWhat challenge are you going to solve first? Is it an issue related to payment infrastructure, insurance, or investment management? Fintech is an incredibly broad industry, so it’s important to be clear on your goals. Are you going to improve or replace something that already exists, or are you looking to bring something entirely new to the market? These are all questions that should be asked in the very initial stages of development.\r\n\r\nFeatures are important, but they are often a secondary reason a customer will buy or use a product. So, it’s important that your offering provides a valuable solution to a very specific problem before worrying about the finer details.\r\n\r\nTo that end, knowing your client is crucial. Product and engineering teams need to have a clear focus as to their end goal and have a strong understanding of who they are building the product for.\r\n\r\nA technology vendor must be specific and strategic when it comes to pursuing the right clients (a particular type of financial services firm, for instance), while also keeping in mind the cultural fit between their team and prospective partners. Ensuring there is a mutual understanding of what the overall vision is and how it will be achieved – including the practical implementation, timeline and costs – will establish a strong foundation for the business-to-business relationship.\r\n\r\nAligning the best technology with best practice\r\n\r\nMeaningful digital transformation is achieved when the best technology aligns with best practice. Developers must resist the urge to jump on the latest technology trends, which might, at best, increase the cost of development or, at worst, significantly set back progress.\r\n\r\nEffective innovation ultimately comes from creating a stronger value proposition for clients. If exciting new architectures or programming languages don’t achieve this, then it is best to leave them out of the equation.\r\n\r\nFintech needs to be created in modern ways, with proven foundational principles in mind. Engineers must be certain their product will remain relevant and valuable for years to come, even if they are no longer there to support it.\r\n\r\nThe end user is key\r\n\r\nThe coronavirus pandemic has made it patently clear that the most successful finance companies are those that have formed partnerships to create technology which can be used seamlessly between separate banking products and accounts. Yobota’s aforementioned research is evidence of that; banking customers are becoming increasingly frustrated with inflexible products and services.\r\n\r\nThe quality and functionality of digital solutions is going to remain of utmost importance going forward. Once people have a taste for the speed, ease and convenience of being able to manage their finance affairs digitally, they will not settle for a return to in-branch meetings, lengthy telephone calls or slow exchanges of paperwork.\r\n\r\nThat is why the voice of the customer must always drive development roadmaps. After all, the happiness of the end user is the strongest indication of success.\r\n\r\nFintechs must consider how they can deftly leverage new and advancing technology to continue to make the customer experience even better, while also improving their underlying product. Interoperability – the ease of integration with other providers – is also an important consideration to bear in mind.\r\n\r\nProgressive fintech promotes partnerships and interoperability to reduce the roadblocks that customers encounter – and it will find innovative ways to bring all of these services into one product.\r\n\r\nThe success of finance companies in the months ahead will, in no small part, be determined by their ability to keep pace with the technological change that is taking place. There is no doubt that developing fintech solutions that are fit for purpose in today’s market is a tall order, but the reward comes from seeing the difference it makes to businesses’ and consumers’ everyday']"

hit fintech,https://www.bobsguide.com/guide/news/2020/Dec/21/risk-rise-in-pandemic-hit-fintech-sector/,1,"['Risk rise in pandemic-hit fintech sector', '\r\n\r\nThe most immediate disruptive threat, although not the biggest, is clearly Brexit because of a welter of regulatory obligations. When UK finally and irrevocably leaves the EU on December 31, it will introduce even more complications for the finance sector\r\nin general and payment service providers (PSPs) in particular.\r\n\r\nThere’s considerable potential for disruption during the transition period in terms of processing payments as UK firms phase in regulatory changes. The authorities will be watching closely. “We expect UK PSPs to have effective risk-based procedures that apply where the transfer of payment lacks the information needed on the payer or the payee,” warns the Prudential Regulation Authority.\r\n\r\nFirms will have to be on the ball in the weeks and months after Brexit. “If any payments are disrupted, we expect firms to communicate promptly with any affected customers….and give them the opportunity to make the payment in another way,” says the PRA.\r\n\r\nBut the most pressing risk is cyber attacks. If there is one issue that strikes at the heart of all firms having custody client funds, it’s security of client’s money, identity and other personal details.\r\n\r\nAs Mastercard reports, fintech is the biggest target of cyber attacks after healthcare. And too many fintech firms are vulnerable. Research by ImmuniWeb, an application security group, has found that 98 percent of the biggest global fintech startups are vulnerable to major cyber attacks. In 2019 the industry saw a 480 percent increase in the number of cyber attacks on regulated financial services companies, according to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), most of them from phishing, ransomware and data leakage.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of attacks has forced the International Monetary Fund to conclude that they amount to a full-on threat to financial stability. “As we become increasingly reliant on digital financial services, the number of cyber attacks has tripled over the last decade, and financial services continue to be the most targeted industry. Cyber security has clearly become a threat to financial stability,” the organisation concludes in a blog in December. “Given strong financial and technological interconnections, a successful attack on a major financial institution, or on a core system or service used by many, could quickly spread through the entire financial system causing widespread disruption and loss of confidence.”\r\n\r\nAnd as the cost of hacking tools collapses and more bad actors get involved, the risks mount. “In our view many national financial systems are not yet ready to manage attacks while international coordination is still weak,” warns the IMF.\r\n\r\nBut management has not yet risen to the challenge either. The pandemic has increased cyber risk because more staff are working remotely, notes cloud security specialist Trend Micro. “Home networks, remote working software and cloud systems will be at the centre of a new wave of attacks in 2021,” it predicts in its latest report Turning the Tide. “Cyber-criminals will particularly look to home networks as a critical launch pad to compromise corporate IT and IoT networks.”\r\n\r\nThe main targets will be anybody who regularly accesses sensitive data such as sales managers holding information about customers and senior executives managing confidential company numbers. Also application programming interfaces (APIs), one of the most important tools of the fintech sector, will come under fire, predicts Trend Micro. “As third-party integrations reign, exposed APIs will become a new preferred attack vector for cyber-criminals, providing access to sensitive customer data, source code and back-end services.\r\n\r\nIn the long run artificial intelligence may come to the rescue by blocking all unauthorised access, but security experts say the looming prospect of a wave of attacks will force firms to invest heavily in training, especially of remote workers, as well as in systems that improve detection and response rates around the clock.\r\n\r\nBy common consent home working has greatly increased the risk of losing vital data. Yet, notes Ireland’s advisory and accounting firm HLB Sheehan Quinn in its 2020 cyber security report, more than half of organisations said their security procedures were not designed for remote working.\r\n\r\nSustainability \r\nA much softer but by no means insubstantial risk arises in investors’ insistence on a culture of sustainability. Put another way, firms that aren’t seen as sustainable will lose potential and actual clients.\r\n\r\nClimate-friendly behaviour is no longer optional as regulations steadily tighten, like the EU’s imminent rules on sustainable finance (SDFR). “Sustainability and responsible investment are becoming mainstream priorities for pension funds, insurers and other investors,” explains Melville Rodrigues, senior consultant for funds services in Ocorian, a specialist in fiduciary services, fund administration and capital markets, in a briefing in December. “Managers are responding with fund products that look to meet these priorities.”\r\n\r\nAnd the obligations are onerous, applying from March 2021 to all products marketed into the EU including from non-EU managers. Rodrigues adds: “The SFDR requires fund managers, such as those operating as alternative investment fund managers (AIFMs), to disclose how they have integrated in their processes, including in their due diligence, an assessment of all relevant sustainability risks that might have a material negative impact on the financial return of a fund investment.”\r\n\r\nBrexit won’t make things any easier. The UK government has already announced it will implement mandatory climate-related financial disclosures right across the economy by 2025 at the latest, but many disclosure obligations will come into force by 2023.\r\nThis is a bottom-line issue for investors who watch firms’ credentials closely. Indeed rating agency Scope has started ranking stock exchanges on the average environmental impact of their component stocks.\r\n\r\n“Our assessment of environmental, social and governance impacts acts like an early warning system for portfolio managers, showing where future regulatory risks and associated costs lie through the analysis of today’s impacts by factor, sector and geography,” said head of ESG Diane Menville in mid-December. Incidentally, also in December France’s CAC40 index scored higher than Germany’s DAX30. “In ESG impact CAC40 has a greener global footprint than DAX30,” notes Scope, putting the former at 6.5 out of a perfect 10 compared with the latter’s 6.3.\r\n\r\nLobby groups are watching too. In mid-December UK-based Make My Money Matter gave a pat on the back to the mighty New York State Pension Fund with $193.4bn under management after it promised to sell shares in companies, mainly oil and gas, by 2040 if they are still contributing to global warming. Meantime Make My Money Matter is lobbying the UK government to require all pension funds to report on their emissions projections up to 2050 and align their portfolios with the Paris Agreement.\r\n\r\nInvestment firms are rapidly waking up to the risks of climate-hostile actions. Luxembourg-based investment manager Lombard Odier is one that has committed to a “bio-friendly” philosophy built around the CLIC economy, standing for circular, lean, inclusive and clean. It’s a new world in investment, say portfolio manager Alina Donets and head of CLIC Kristina Church. “Global businesses already recognise the need for transformation toward circular and lean operating models,” they explain in a paper released in December.\r\n\r\nThis is seen as virtuous and profitable. Lombard Odier has identified 550 bio-friendly companies, mostly small and mid-cap, that offer “superior growth profiles and excess economic returns, combined with solid ESG credentials including assessment of any controversies.”\r\n\r\nFrench neo-insurer Luko could be the new model. The home insurance specialist, which has just raised €50m in a second round of funding, has grown six times since its launch in 2018 on the back of the kind of ethical behaviour that increasingly attracts customers. At the end of every financial year the insurtech, boasting 100,000 clients, hands to charities any premiums in the pool that haven’t been used to refund claims. The policyholders choose the charities.\r\n\r\nKeeping up\r\nIn a fast-developing industry based on high technology, firms that fail to keep up will suffer, for instance in cross-border payments. As the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) pointed out in a report in August, cross-border payments are generally “slower, more expensive, less transparent and less accessible than domestic payments.” Consequently, the G20 has made them a top priority and has asked the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to address systemic issues.\r\n\r\nAs a report by America’s Association for Financial Professionals makes clear, this will necessarily involve investment, planning and technology. Citing the importance of “operational improvements that can be made to domestic and international payment infrastructures,” notes the association in November, the FSB sees opportunities to reduce problems caused by different operating hours, long transaction chains, high funding costs, access regimes, and weak competition.”\r\n\r\nThe pandemic has made reforms more urgent. As the association notes, the BIS believes that the crisis has “amplified calls to reinforce coordination and reduce fragmentation in cross-border payment systems.”\r\n\r\nAnd that may increase competition in a shrunken, pandemic-hit market. As McKinsey & Co has calculated, global payments revenue will probably fall by seven per cent – equivalent to $170bn – in 2020. And the established institutions are fighting back. Working with more than 20 banks, SWIFT is expanding into lower-value transfers for SMEs and consumers with fewer friction points in what it calls “predictable payments”.\r\n\r\nIn this market there are only the quick and the']"

But fintech activity is growing rapidly. Digital payment schemes are expanding within countries, although cross-border and pan-euro area instruments are not yet widespread, notwithstanding important enabling EU level regulation and the establishment of instant payments by the ECB. Automated lending models are developing but remain limited mainly to unsecured consumer lending. While start-ups are pursuing platform-based approaches under minimal regulation, there is a clear trend for fintech companies to acquire balance sheets and, relatedly, banking licenses as they expand. Meanwhile, competition is pushing many traditional banks to adopt fintech instruments, either in-house or by acquisition, thereby causing them to increasingly resemble balanced sheet-based fintech companies. These developments could improve the efficiency and reach of financial intermediation while also adding to profitability pressures for some banks. Although the COVID-19 pandemic could call into question the viability of platform-based lending fintechs funding models given that investors could face much higher  delinquencies, it may also offer growth opportunities to those fintechs that are positioned to take advantage of the ongoing structural shift in demand toward virtual finance.', 'lending,payment system,European Union,Payments Directive,PSD2,WP,Fintech company,direct debit,micro-enterprise lending,individual investor,Big-tech company,crowdfunding firm,due diligence,payment company,value chain,venture capital']"

Recent developments suggest that regulatory approaches and their legal foundations need to augment entity-based regulation with increasing focus on activities and risks as market structure changes.

An analytical framework based on a four-step process is proposed—(i) identifying payment activities; (ii) licensing entities and designating systems; (iii) analyzing and managing risks, and (iv) promoting legal certainty.

We estimate bank-level intensity of IT adoption before the global financial crisis using a novel dataset that provides information on hardware used in US commercial bank branches after mapping them to their parent bank. We find that higher intensity of IT-adoption led to significantly lower non-performing loans when the crisis hit: banks with a one standard deviation higher IT-adoption experienced 10% lower non-performing loans. High-IT-adoption banks were not less exposed to the crisis through their geographical footprint, business model, funding sources, or other observable characteristics. Loan-level analysis indicates that high-IT-adoption banks originated mortgages with better performance and did not offload low-quality loans. We apply a simple text-analysis algorithm to the biographies of top executives and find that banks led by more “tech-oriented” managers adopted IT more intensively and experienced lower non-performing loans during the crisis. Our results suggest that technology adoption in lending can enhance financial stability through the production of more resilient loans.', 'Technology,Financial Stability,IT Adoption,Non-Performing Loans,WP,pre-crisis,GFC,non-performing loan,Rajan']"

We examine the impact of the funding of such start-ups on the stock returns of 47 incumbent US retail banks for 2010 to 2016. To capture the importance of FinTech start-ups, we use data on both the dollar-volume of funding and number of deals. We relate these to the stock returns with panel data regression methods. Our results indicate a positive relationship exists between the growth in FinTech funding or deals and the contemporaneous stock returns of incumbent retail banks. Although these results suggest complementarity between FinTech and traditional banking, we note that our results at the banking industry level are not statistically significant, and that the coefficient signs for about one-third of the banks are negative, but not statistically significant. Since the FinTech industry is young and our sample period short, we cannot rule out that our findings are spurious.']"

That means \r\nassessing creditworthiness before making a loan and then monitoring \r\nborrowers to ensure timely payment in full. Lenders have three principal \r\ntools for raising the likelihood of that firms will repay. First, they look \r\nfor borrowers with a sufficiently large personal stake in their enterprise. \r\nSecond, they look for firms with collateral that lenders can seize in the \r\nevent of a default. Third, they obtain information on the firm’s current \r\nbalance sheet, its historical revenue and profits, experience with past \r\nloans, and the like.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this conventional approach to overcoming the challenges of \r\nasymmetric information is less effective for new firms that have both very \r\nshort credit histories and very little in the way of physical collateral. \r\nAs a result, these potential borrowers have trouble obtaining funds through \r\nstandard channels. This is one reason that governments subsidize small \r\nbusiness lending, and why entrepreneurs are forced to pledge their homes as \r\ncollateral.\r\n\r\nWell, new solutions have emerged to overcome this old problem. In this post \r\nwe discuss how technology is increasing small firms’ access to credit. By \r\nusing massive amounts of data to improve credit assessments, as well as \r\nreal-time information and platform advantages to enforce repayment terms, \r\ntechnology companies appear to be doing what traditional lenders have not: \r\nmaking loans to millions of small businesses at attractive rates and \r\nexperiencing remarkably low default rates.\r\n\r\nThe biggest advances are in places where financial systems are not meeting \r\nsocial needs….']"

But fintech activity is growing rapidly. Digital payment schemes are expanding within countries, although cross-border and pan-euro area instruments are not yet widespread, notwithstanding important enabling EU level regulation and the establishment of instant payments by the ECB. Automated lending models are developing but remain limited mainly to unsecured consumer lending. While start-ups are pursuing platform-based approaches under minimal regulation, there is a clear trend for fintech companies to acquire balance sheets and, relatedly, banking licenses as they expand. Meanwhile, competition is pushing many traditional banks to adopt fintech instruments, either in-house or by acquisition, thereby causing them to increasingly resemble balanced sheet-based fintech companies. These developments could improve the efficiency and reach of financial intermediation while also adding to profitability pressures for some banks. Although the COVID-19 pandemic could call into question the viability of platform-based lending fintechs funding models given that investors could face much higher  delinquencies, it may also offer growth opportunities to those fintechs that are positioned to take advantage of the ongoing structural shift in demand toward virtual finance.', 'lending,payment system,European Union,Payments Directive,PSD2,WP,Fintech company,direct debit,micro-enterprise lending,individual investor,Big-tech company,crowdfunding firm,due diligence,payment company,value chain,venture capital']"

Corporates, venture capital and private equity firms have invested more than US$50 billion in almost 2 500 global FinTech start-ups since 2010.\nThe rapidly growing FinTech sector has its rewards and challenges (e.g. data and consumer protection issues, risk of exacerbating financial volatility and cybercrime) and is increasingly attracting political attention. The European Commission set up a Financial Technology Task Force (FTTF), and the European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee (ECON) presented its draft report on FinTech in January 2017. At G20 level, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) will present its study scrutinising FinTech in July 2017.\nDue to the broad scope of FinTech, regulators can face a dilemma: rule-based regulatory frameworks set out compliance obligations clearly, but these are often expensive from a start-up perspective and could be an obstacle to innovation and job creation; principle-based regulation is more flexible, but could create some uncertainty as to what exactly is expected in terms of compliance.', 'european parliament, parliament, europe']"

Wealth managers are standing at the epicenter of a tectonic shift, as the balance of power between offering and demand undergoes a dramatic upheaval. Regulators are pushing toward a constrained offering norm while private clients and independent advisors demand a more proactive role; practitioners need examine this banking evolution in detail to understand the mechanisms at work. This book presents analysis of the current shift and offers clear insight into what happens when established economic interests collide with social transformation. Business models are changing in profound ways, and the impact reaches further than many expect; the democratization of banking is revolutionizing the wealth management industry toward more efficient and client-centric advisory processes, and keeping pace with these changes has become a survival skill for financial advisors around the world.  Social media, big data analytics and digital technology are disrupting the banking industry, which many have taken for granted as set in stone. This book shatters that assumption by illustrating the massive changes already underway, and provides thought leader insight into the changes yet to come.    Examine the depth and breadth of financial technology  Learn how regulations are driving changing business models  Discover why investors may become the price-makers  Understand the forces at work behind the rise of FinTech    Information asymmetry has dominated the banking industry for centuries, keeping the bank/investor liability neatly alignedbut this is changing, and understanding and preparing for the repercussions must be a top priority for wealth managers everywhere.

shielded fintech,https://www.bobsguide.com/guide/news/2021/Feb/26/evolution-of-fintechs-prevents-brexit-headaches/,7,"['Evolution of fintechs prevents Brexit headaches', '\r\n\r\nThere had been fears that Brexit would see the swift decline of London as a prominent fintech hub. Those fears have only increased in recent weeks after the Financial Times reported that Amsterdam had overtaken London as Europe’s top share trading centre in the wake of Brexit. Meanwhile, Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey accused the EU of a “serious escalation” for trying to take derivatives clearing business away from the City.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is less clear whether the tug of war between the EU and the UK over financial services is being fought as strongly in the fintech space.\r\n\r\nBisgaard says this is because fintechs are a different beast to a few years ago with a different responsibility in the financial services ecosystem and possessing a far closer relationship to large financial services firms.\r\n\r\n“In the old days, a fintech was oftentimes two guys and a dog in a garage doing a mobile app. Those days are gone – fintechs have a different role today,” Bisgaard says.\r\n\r\n“All of a sudden, they’re on the inside looking out, rather than on the outside doing a mobile app and there’s a massive difference in that.”\r\n\r\nBecause of this closer alignment with established financial players, Bisgaard says that the potential difficulties over passporting and other as of yet unresolved issues between the UK and EU have not conspired to make London or the UK an unattractive location for fintechs.\r\n\r\nDespite this, the UK government is aware they cannot rest on their laurels. The long-awaited Kalifa review into the fintech sector, published February 26, notes that the future of UK fintech is at a critical “inflection point” and the government must help the sector tackle three key threats: Competition, Brexit and coronavirus.\r\n\r\n“While the UK’s position is well established, its future is not assured,” the report warned.\xa0\r\n\r\nConcern for start-ups\r\n\r\nJames Allum, vice president and head of Europe at global payments fintech Payoneer says that many organisations like his decided well before the Brexit deadline to incorporate an entity in the EU to ensure their service continued across the continent regardless of how Brexit negotiations unfolded.\r\n\r\n“What’s happened is that it’s been a bit of survival of the fittest and the biggest,” Allum says. “The banks have pretty much done the same. They were probably some of the first to move some of their operations and regulatory stuff across to the EU – and the largest fintechs have done the same.”\r\n\r\nHelene Panzarino, head of fintech and community bank strategic partnerships at fintech provider Vacuumlabs, says everyone in the fintech space started opening offices in places like Ireland as soon as the Brexit referendum result was announced in June 2016.\r\n\r\nWhile creating satellite offices in places such as Ireland or the Netherlands is relatively painless for a large, well-established fintech, Allum is concerned about the impact Brexit will have on smaller, younger outfits.\r\n\r\n“The pain in fintech has definitely been for the smaller firms,” he says. “It’s about £1m to set up a UK e-money licence, just in terms of legal costs and capital required. There are a lot of start-ups that are really being pushed and have probably been forced to make a decision of whether or not they just stay UK-focused or try and partner with someone for an EU licence.”\r\n\r\nHowever, while Brexit has increased regulatory issues and made accessing funding more difficult for start-ups in the UK, Allum says these trends are not entirely a direct consequence of Britain’s departure from the bloc.\r\n\r\n“We’ll probably see a bit more consolidation in the fintech space,” he says. “It’s a trend in the last few years that we’ve seen less and less start-ups. General regulatory costs have been prohibitive to many new entrants into the market.”\r\n\r\nLike Bisgaard, Allum says that as fintechs have evolved the barriers to entry have gone up, meaning the “ship has sailed” to a large extent for smaller fintechs, regardless of Brexit.\r\n\r\nIn place of fledgling fintech start-ups, there has been an increased drive towards working with established banks.\r\n\r\n“We’ve now got about 20 banking partnerships, whereas a few years ago the partnership was on the other side,” Allum says. “Now, we’re actually offering it [our services] to banks and banking platforms to help them with their growing pains.”\r\n\r\nAs fintechs have matured their business models to work with rather than against banks, they have also developed as a coherent community to the extent that Panzarino says the sector has direct lines of communication to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak MP.\r\n\r\n“Everyone is mature enough now to understand how to navigate. There’s enough of a collective swell and subtle pressure, sometimes very overt pressure, on governments and regulators to make sure that fintech gets looked after,” she says.\r\n']"

But fintech activity is growing rapidly. Digital payment schemes are expanding within countries, although cross-border and pan-euro area instruments are not yet widespread, notwithstanding important enabling EU level regulation and the establishment of instant payments by the ECB. Automated lending models are developing but remain limited mainly to unsecured consumer lending. While start-ups are pursuing platform-based approaches under minimal regulation, there is a clear trend for fintech companies to acquire balance sheets and, relatedly, banking licenses as they expand. Meanwhile, competition is pushing many traditional banks to adopt fintech instruments, either in-house or by acquisition, thereby causing them to increasingly resemble balanced sheet-based fintech companies. These developments could improve the efficiency and reach of financial intermediation while also adding to profitability pressures for some banks. Although the COVID-19 pandemic could call into question the viability of platform-based lending fintechs funding models given that investors could face much higher  delinquencies, it may also offer growth opportunities to those fintechs that are positioned to take advantage of the ongoing structural shift in demand toward virtual finance.', 'lending,payment system,European Union,Payments Directive,PSD2,WP,Fintech company,direct debit,micro-enterprise lending,individual investor,Big-tech company,crowdfunding firm,due diligence,payment company,value chain,venture capital']"

vulnerable fintech,https://www.bobsguide.com/guide/news/2020/Dec/21/risk-rise-in-pandemic-hit-fintech-sector/,6,"['Risk rise in pandemic-hit fintech sector', '\r\n\r\nThe most immediate disruptive threat, although not the biggest, is clearly Brexit because of a welter of regulatory obligations. When UK finally and irrevocably leaves the EU on December 31, it will introduce even more complications for the finance sector\r\nin general and payment service providers (PSPs) in particular.\r\n\r\nThere’s considerable potential for disruption during the transition period in terms of processing payments as UK firms phase in regulatory changes. The authorities will be watching closely. “We expect UK PSPs to have effective risk-based procedures that apply where the transfer of payment lacks the information needed on the payer or the payee,” warns the Prudential Regulation Authority.\r\n\r\nFirms will have to be on the ball in the weeks and months after Brexit. “If any payments are disrupted, we expect firms to communicate promptly with any affected customers….and give them the opportunity to make the payment in another way,” says the PRA.\r\n\r\nBut the most pressing risk is cyber attacks. If there is one issue that strikes at the heart of all firms having custody client funds, it’s security of client’s money, identity and other personal details.\r\n\r\nAs Mastercard reports, fintech is the biggest target of cyber attacks after healthcare. And too many fintech firms are vulnerable. Research by ImmuniWeb, an application security group, has found that 98 percent of the biggest global fintech startups are vulnerable to major cyber attacks. In 2019 the industry saw a 480 percent increase in the number of cyber attacks on regulated financial services companies, according to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), most of them from phishing, ransomware and data leakage.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of attacks has forced the International Monetary Fund to conclude that they amount to a full-on threat to financial stability. “As we become increasingly reliant on digital financial services, the number of cyber attacks has tripled over the last decade, and financial services continue to be the most targeted industry. Cyber security has clearly become a threat to financial stability,” the organisation concludes in a blog in December. “Given strong financial and technological interconnections, a successful attack on a major financial institution, or on a core system or service used by many, could quickly spread through the entire financial system causing widespread disruption and loss of confidence.”\r\n\r\nAnd as the cost of hacking tools collapses and more bad actors get involved, the risks mount. “In our view many national financial systems are not yet ready to manage attacks while international coordination is still weak,” warns the IMF.\r\n\r\nBut management has not yet risen to the challenge either. The pandemic has increased cyber risk because more staff are working remotely, notes cloud security specialist Trend Micro. “Home networks, remote working software and cloud systems will be at the centre of a new wave of attacks in 2021,” it predicts in its latest report Turning the Tide. “Cyber-criminals will particularly look to home networks as a critical launch pad to compromise corporate IT and IoT networks.”\r\n\r\nThe main targets will be anybody who regularly accesses sensitive data such as sales managers holding information about customers and senior executives managing confidential company numbers. Also application programming interfaces (APIs), one of the most important tools of the fintech sector, will come under fire, predicts Trend Micro. “As third-party integrations reign, exposed APIs will become a new preferred attack vector for cyber-criminals, providing access to sensitive customer data, source code and back-end services.\r\n\r\nIn the long run artificial intelligence may come to the rescue by blocking all unauthorised access, but security experts say the looming prospect of a wave of attacks will force firms to invest heavily in training, especially of remote workers, as well as in systems that improve detection and response rates around the clock.\r\n\r\nBy common consent home working has greatly increased the risk of losing vital data. Yet, notes Ireland’s advisory and accounting firm HLB Sheehan Quinn in its 2020 cyber security report, more than half of organisations said their security procedures were not designed for remote working.\r\n\r\nSustainability \r\nA much softer but by no means insubstantial risk arises in investors’ insistence on a culture of sustainability. Put another way, firms that aren’t seen as sustainable will lose potential and actual clients.\r\n\r\nClimate-friendly behaviour is no longer optional as regulations steadily tighten, like the EU’s imminent rules on sustainable finance (SDFR). “Sustainability and responsible investment are becoming mainstream priorities for pension funds, insurers and other investors,” explains Melville Rodrigues, senior consultant for funds services in Ocorian, a specialist in fiduciary services, fund administration and capital markets, in a briefing in December. “Managers are responding with fund products that look to meet these priorities.”\r\n\r\nAnd the obligations are onerous, applying from March 2021 to all products marketed into the EU including from non-EU managers. Rodrigues adds: “The SFDR requires fund managers, such as those operating as alternative investment fund managers (AIFMs), to disclose how they have integrated in their processes, including in their due diligence, an assessment of all relevant sustainability risks that might have a material negative impact on the financial return of a fund investment.”\r\n\r\nBrexit won’t make things any easier. The UK government has already announced it will implement mandatory climate-related financial disclosures right across the economy by 2025 at the latest, but many disclosure obligations will come into force by 2023.\r\nThis is a bottom-line issue for investors who watch firms’ credentials closely. Indeed rating agency Scope has started ranking stock exchanges on the average environmental impact of their component stocks.\r\n\r\n“Our assessment of environmental, social and governance impacts acts like an early warning system for portfolio managers, showing where future regulatory risks and associated costs lie through the analysis of today’s impacts by factor, sector and geography,” said head of ESG Diane Menville in mid-December. Incidentally, also in December France’s CAC40 index scored higher than Germany’s DAX30. “In ESG impact CAC40 has a greener global footprint than DAX30,” notes Scope, putting the former at 6.5 out of a perfect 10 compared with the latter’s 6.3.\r\n\r\nLobby groups are watching too. In mid-December UK-based Make My Money Matter gave a pat on the back to the mighty New York State Pension Fund with $193.4bn under management after it promised to sell shares in companies, mainly oil and gas, by 2040 if they are still contributing to global warming. Meantime Make My Money Matter is lobbying the UK government to require all pension funds to report on their emissions projections up to 2050 and align their portfolios with the Paris Agreement.\r\n\r\nInvestment firms are rapidly waking up to the risks of climate-hostile actions. Luxembourg-based investment manager Lombard Odier is one that has committed to a “bio-friendly” philosophy built around the CLIC economy, standing for circular, lean, inclusive and clean. It’s a new world in investment, say portfolio manager Alina Donets and head of CLIC Kristina Church. “Global businesses already recognise the need for transformation toward circular and lean operating models,” they explain in a paper released in December.\r\n\r\nThis is seen as virtuous and profitable. Lombard Odier has identified 550 bio-friendly companies, mostly small and mid-cap, that offer “superior growth profiles and excess economic returns, combined with solid ESG credentials including assessment of any controversies.”\r\n\r\nFrench neo-insurer Luko could be the new model. The home insurance specialist, which has just raised €50m in a second round of funding, has grown six times since its launch in 2018 on the back of the kind of ethical behaviour that increasingly attracts customers. At the end of every financial year the insurtech, boasting 100,000 clients, hands to charities any premiums in the pool that haven’t been used to refund claims. The policyholders choose the charities.\r\n\r\nKeeping up\r\nIn a fast-developing industry based on high technology, firms that fail to keep up will suffer, for instance in cross-border payments. As the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) pointed out in a report in August, cross-border payments are generally “slower, more expensive, less transparent and less accessible than domestic payments.” Consequently, the G20 has made them a top priority and has asked the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to address systemic issues.\r\n\r\nAs a report by America’s Association for Financial Professionals makes clear, this will necessarily involve investment, planning and technology. Citing the importance of “operational improvements that can be made to domestic and international payment infrastructures,” notes the association in November, the FSB sees opportunities to reduce problems caused by different operating hours, long transaction chains, high funding costs, access regimes, and weak competition.”\r\n\r\nThe pandemic has made reforms more urgent. As the association notes, the BIS believes that the crisis has “amplified calls to reinforce coordination and reduce fragmentation in cross-border payment systems.”\r\n\r\nAnd that may increase competition in a shrunken, pandemic-hit market. As McKinsey & Co has calculated, global payments revenue will probably fall by seven per cent – equivalent to $170bn – in 2020. And the established institutions are fighting back. Working with more than 20 banks, SWIFT is expanding into lower-value transfers for SMEs and consumers with fewer friction points in what it calls “predictable payments”.\r\n\r\nIn this market there are only the quick and the']"
