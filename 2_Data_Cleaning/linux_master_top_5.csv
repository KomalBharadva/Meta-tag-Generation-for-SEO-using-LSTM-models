fintech attack,https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/12/2020-review-top-five-cyberattacks-this-year/,1,"2020 has been a tumultuous year, and with coronavirus hogging the headlines, a few cybersecurity-related stories slipped through the net."
fintech attack,https://www.bobsguide.com/guide/news/2020/Dec/21/risk-rise-in-pandemic-hit-fintech-sector/,4,"Risk rise in pandemic-hit fintech sector, \r\n\r\nThe most immediate disruptive threat, although not the biggest, is clearly Brexit because of a welter of regulatory obligations. When UK finally and irrevocably leaves the EU on December 31, it will introduce even more complications for the finance sector\r\nin general and payment service providers (PSPs) in particular.\r\n\r\nThere’s considerable potential for disruption during the transition period in terms of processing payments as UK firms phase in regulatory changes. The authorities will be watching closely. “We expect UK PSPs to have effective risk-based procedures that apply where the transfer of payment lacks the information needed on the payer or the payee,” warns the Prudential Regulation Authority.\r\n\r\nFirms will have to be on the ball in the weeks and months after Brexit. “If any payments are disrupted, we expect firms to communicate promptly with any affected customers….and give them the opportunity to make the payment in another way,” says the PRA.\r\n\r\nBut the most pressing risk is cyber attacks. If there is one issue that strikes at the heart of all firms having custody client funds, it’s security of client’s money, identity and other personal details.\r\n\r\nAs Mastercard reports, fintech is the biggest target of cyber attacks after healthcare. And too many fintech firms are vulnerable. Research by ImmuniWeb, an application security group, has found that 98 percent of the biggest global fintech startups are vulnerable to major cyber attacks. In 2019 the industry saw a 480 percent increase in the number of cyber attacks on regulated financial services companies, according to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), most of them from phishing, ransomware and data leakage.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of attacks has forced the International Monetary Fund to conclude that they amount to a full-on threat to financial stability. “As we become increasingly reliant on digital financial services, the number of cyber attacks has tripled over the last decade, and financial services continue to be the most targeted industry. Cyber security has clearly become a threat to financial stability,” the organisation concludes in a blog in December. “Given strong financial and technological interconnections, a successful attack on a major financial institution, or on a core system or service used by many, could quickly spread through the entire financial system causing widespread disruption and loss of confidence.”\r\n\r\nAnd as the cost of hacking tools collapses and more bad actors get involved, the risks mount. “In our view many national financial systems are not yet ready to manage attacks while international coordination is still weak,” warns the IMF.\r\n\r\nBut management has not yet risen to the challenge either. The pandemic has increased cyber risk because more staff are working remotely, notes cloud security specialist Trend Micro. “Home networks, remote working software and cloud systems will be at the centre of a new wave of attacks in 2021,” it predicts in its latest report Turning the Tide. “Cyber-criminals will particularly look to home networks as a critical launch pad to compromise corporate IT and IoT networks.”\r\n\r\nThe main targets will be anybody who regularly accesses sensitive data such as sales managers holding information about customers and senior executives managing confidential company numbers. Also application programming interfaces (APIs), one of the most important tools of the fintech sector, will come under fire, predicts Trend Micro. “As third-party integrations reign, exposed APIs will become a new preferred attack vector for cyber-criminals, providing access to sensitive customer data, source code and back-end services.\r\n\r\nIn the long run artificial intelligence may come to the rescue by blocking all unauthorised access, but security experts say the looming prospect of a wave of attacks will force firms to invest heavily in training, especially of remote workers, as well as in systems that improve detection and response rates around the clock.\r\n\r\nBy common consent home working has greatly increased the risk of losing vital data. Yet, notes Ireland’s advisory and accounting firm HLB Sheehan Quinn in its 2020 cyber security report, more than half of organisations said their security procedures were not designed for remote working.\r\n\r\nSustainability \r\nA much softer but by no means insubstantial risk arises in investors’ insistence on a culture of sustainability. Put another way, firms that aren’t seen as sustainable will lose potential and actual clients.\r\n\r\nClimate-friendly behaviour is no longer optional as regulations steadily tighten, like the EU’s imminent rules on sustainable finance (SDFR). “Sustainability and responsible investment are becoming mainstream priorities for pension funds, insurers and other investors,” explains Melville Rodrigues, senior consultant for funds services in Ocorian, a specialist in fiduciary services, fund administration and capital markets, in a briefing in December. “Managers are responding with fund products that look to meet these priorities.”\r\n\r\nAnd the obligations are onerous, applying from March 2021 to all products marketed into the EU including from non-EU managers. Rodrigues adds: “The SFDR requires fund managers, such as those operating as alternative investment fund managers (AIFMs), to disclose how they have integrated in their processes, including in their due diligence, an assessment of all relevant sustainability risks that might have a material negative impact on the financial return of a fund investment.”\r\n\r\nBrexit won’t make things any easier. The UK government has already announced it will implement mandatory climate-related financial disclosures right across the economy by 2025 at the latest, but many disclosure obligations will come into force by 2023.\r\nThis is a bottom-line issue for investors who watch firms’ credentials closely. Indeed rating agency Scope has started ranking stock exchanges on the average environmental impact of their component stocks.\r\n\r\n“Our assessment of environmental, social and governance impacts acts like an early warning system for portfolio managers, showing where future regulatory risks and associated costs lie through the analysis of today’s impacts by factor, sector and geography,” said head of ESG Diane Menville in mid-December. Incidentally, also in December France’s CAC40 index scored higher than Germany’s DAX30. “In ESG impact CAC40 has a greener global footprint than DAX30,” notes Scope, putting the former at 6.5 out of a perfect 10 compared with the latter’s 6.3.\r\n\r\nLobby groups are watching too. In mid-December UK-based Make My Money Matter gave a pat on the back to the mighty New York State Pension Fund with 193.4bn under management after it promised to sell shares in companies, mainly oil and gas, by 2040 if they are still contributing to global warming. Meantime Make My Money Matter is lobbying the UK government to require all pension funds to report on their emissions projections up to 2050 and align their portfolios with the Paris Agreement.\r\n\r\nInvestment firms are rapidly waking up to the risks of climate-hostile actions. Luxembourg-based investment manager Lombard Odier is one that has committed to a “bio-friendly” philosophy built around the CLIC economy, standing for circular, lean, inclusive and clean. It’s a new world in investment, say portfolio manager Alina Donets and head of CLIC Kristina Church. “Global businesses already recognise the need for transformation toward circular and lean operating models,” they explain in a paper released in December.\r\n\r\nThis is seen as virtuous and profitable. Lombard Odier has identified 550 bio-friendly companies, mostly small and mid-cap, that offer “superior growth profiles and excess economic returns, combined with solid ESG credentials including assessment of any controversies.”\r\n\r\nFrench neo-insurer Luko could be the new model. The home insurance specialist, which has just raised €50m in a second round of funding, has grown six times since its launch in 2018 on the back of the kind of ethical behaviour that increasingly attracts customers. At the end of every financial year the insurtech, boasting 100,000 clients, hands to charities any premiums in the pool that haven’t been used to refund claims. The policyholders choose the charities.\r\n\r\nKeeping up\r\nIn a fast-developing industry based on high technology, firms that fail to keep up will suffer, for instance in cross-border payments. As the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) pointed out in a report in August, cross-border payments are generally “slower, more expensive, less transparent and less accessible than domestic payments.” Consequently, the G20 has made them a top priority and has asked the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to address systemic issues.\r\n\r\nAs a report by America’s Association for Financial Professionals makes clear, this will necessarily involve investment, planning and technology. Citing the importance of “operational improvements that can be made to domestic and international payment infrastructures,” notes the association in November, the FSB sees opportunities to reduce problems caused by different operating hours, long transaction chains, high funding costs, access regimes, and weak competition.”\r\n\r\nThe pandemic has made reforms more urgent. As the association notes, the BIS believes that the crisis has “amplified calls to reinforce coordination and reduce fragmentation in cross-border payment systems.”\r\n\r\nAnd that may increase competition in a shrunken, pandemic-hit market. As McKinsey & Co has calculated, global payments revenue will probably fall by seven per cent – equivalent to 170bn – in 2020. And the established institutions are fighting back. Working with more than 20 banks, SWIFT is expanding into lower-value transfers for SMEs and consumers with fewer friction points in what it calls “predictable payments”.\r\n\r\nIn this market there are only the quick and the"

fintech double,https://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cklawreview/vol93/iss1/2/,3,"This symposium essay examines the double-edged nature of financial technologies in financial transactions, especially transactions involving consumers. There are both benefits and risks—often undiscovered or hidden at first—in each new round of financial technologies. A FinTech tool may benefit consumers and then, applied later or in a different context, threaten consumer interests; a tool that harms consumer interests may then lead to development of a tool that favors them. This double-edged nature is an important but unappreciated structural feature of financial technologies. From the perspective of consumer protection, then, FinTech can neither be fully embraced as friend nor restricted as foe. Rather, it must be regulated with sensitivity to various competing goals: fostering innovation, policing abuse, and protecting access to markets, to financial services, and to the legal system. This essay cautiously endorses several strategies: the use of purposive and compliance-driven regulatory frameworks; regulatory “sandboxes” and other experimentalist and stakeholder-participatory approaches to FinTech governance; and the development of consumer-protective and consumer-enabling FinTech. It also calls attention the issues of distributive justice and equity that arise when there are prohibitive financial or cognitive barriers to effective use of FinTech; in other words, it calls attention to the fact that access to fair participation in the markets and access to justice may increasingly rely on access to FinTech., FinTech, Banking and Finance, Data Aggregation, Automation"

What impact might fintech have on financial services, and how should regulation respond? This paper sets out an economic framework for thinking through the channels by which fintech might provide solutions that respond to consumer needs for trust, security, privacy, and better services, change the competitive landscape, and affect regulation. It combines a broad discussion of trends across financial services with a focus on cross-border payments and especially the impact of distributed ledger technology. Overall, the paper finds that boundaries among different types of service providers are blurring; barriers to entry are changing; and improvements in cross-border payments are likely. It argues that regulatory authorities need to balance carefully efficiency and stability trade-offs in the face of rapid changes, and ensure that trust is maintained in an evolving financial system. It also highlights the importance of international cooperation., Fintech,cross border payments,market structure,financial regulation,financial stability,monetary policy,virtual currencies,digital currencies,competition,entry,intermediaries,concentration,market contestability,vertical integration,horizontal integration,product differentiation,network externalities,economies of scale,barriers to entry,sunk costs,fixed costs,information asymmetries,transaction costs,matching,innovation,adoption,cross-border payments,General,Government Policy and Regulation,Government Policy and Regulation"

The increasing pervasiveness of technology-driven firms that offer financial services has led to growing pressure on traditional banks to modernize their core business activities. Many banks tackle the challenges of digitalization by cooperating with startup firms that offer technology-driven financial services (fintechs). In this paper, we examine which banks typically collaborate with fintechs, how intensely they do so, and which form of alliance they prefer. Using hand-collected data covering the largest banks from Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, we provide detailed evidence on the different forms of alliances occurring in practice. We show that banks are significantly more likely to form alliances with fintechs when they pursue a well-defined digital strategy and/or employ a chief digital officer. Moreover, in line with incomplete contract theory, we find that banks more frequently invest in small fintechs but often build product-related collaborations with larger fintechs., fintech; strategic alliance; make; buy; or ally; entrepreneurial finance; banks"

In recent years, Fintech companies, defined as organizations that combine innovative business models and technology to enable, enhance and disrupt financial services, have gained substantial funding and are the main drivers of innovation and digitalisation. Projections show that Fintech companies are expected to take away up to 60% of the revenues of the traditional banking sector within the next ten years. This topic is particularly relevant for Switzerland as one of the main global financial centers. Worldwide Venture Capital (VC) investment in Fintech ventures tripled in 2014 to more than 12 billion, while the Swiss banking industry is substantially lacking behind compared to other world financial centres. As a reaction, the Swiss government has now set Fintech as a top priority on their agenda. This research project will help in the transformation of the Swiss finance industry by laying the academic and mathematical foundations for the use of Fintech in the area of algorithmic strategies, risk management and investment banking. Its academic concepts and conclusions can also be used in a more general context and applied to a larger range of industries.

fintech prospect,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document.html?reference=EPRS_BRI(2017)599348,5,"FinTech, the abbreviation for financial technology, is a broad term. It is mainly used to refer to firms that use technology-based systems either to provide financial services and products directly, or to try to make the financial system more efficient. Examples include robotic trading, cashless payments, crowdfunding platforms, robo-advice, and virtual currencies. The value of global FinTech investment in 2015 grew by 75 % to US22.3 billion. Corporates, venture capital and private equity firms have invested more than US50 billion in almost 2 500 global FinTech start-ups since 2010.\nThe rapidly growing FinTech sector has its rewards and challenges (e.g. data and consumer protection issues, risk of exacerbating financial volatility and cybercrime) and is increasingly attracting political attention. The European Commission set up a Financial Technology Task Force (FTTF), and the European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee (ECON) presented its draft report on FinTech in January 2017. At G20 level, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) will present its study scrutinising FinTech in July 2017.\nDue to the broad scope of FinTech, regulators can face a dilemma: rule-based regulatory frameworks set out compliance obligations clearly, but these are often expensive from a start-up perspective and could be an obstacle to innovation and job creation; principle-based regulation is more flexible, but could create some uncertainty as to what exactly is expected in terms of compliance., european parliament, parliament, europe"

In doing so, the group will work with more than 150 global fintech associations and ecosystem partners and disseminate the survey to over 15,000 fintech firms in 190 jurisdictions.\xa0The survey will collect globally comparable empirical data to inform evidence-based regulation, policy and business decision-making in a timely fashion. All survey data collected will be anonymized and aggregated before analysis and presentation.Based on the findings, the collaboration will jointly publish a report in September 2020. In turn, fintech industries and Digital Financial Services (DFS) providers can better position themselves not only to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 but also to identify opportunities to scale and expand, as the digitalization of financial services is likely to become increasingly more important in a post-COVID world.\xa0, World Economic Forum,WEF,Davos,Klaus Schwab, globalization, globalization4.0, globalization4, globalization four, what does globalization mean?"

concerned fintech,https://www.bobsguide.com/guide/news/2020/Oct/9/financial-services-should-be-worried-about-big-tech-not-fintech/,2,"Financial services should be worried about big tech not fintech, \r\n\r\nSpeaking on a Sibos 2020 panel, Michael King, Lansdowne chair in finance at the Gustavson School of Business at the University of Victoria said big techs will be more a threat to traditional financial service players than fintechs were six years ago.\r\n\r\n“Rather than being threatened by fintech start-ups, which was the initial hypothesis and story being put up by the media. Our conclusion is that banks will be more threatened by large technology companies like Chinese techfins such as Alibaba and Tencent. And the big tech companies in North America, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.”\r\n\r\n“These tech companies have the platform ecosystems that embed financial services, including payments, lending, investing and insurance. We believe these tech fins and big tech players will prove to be the real threats to incumbents over the next decade.”\r\nTheir other prediction is that there will be more cooperation between financial services and fintechs.\r\n\r\n“The most successful incumbents will partner with FinTech start-ups to provide better experience to their customers at a lower cost,” said Richard Nesbitt, professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.\r\n\r\nKing said that cooperation between the two has been spurred by the fact that for the most part, financial tech and service providers are not competing for the same market.\r\n\r\n“Fintechs are building a foothold at the low end of the market targeting underserved customers, particularly millennials, whose expectations for customer experiences had been really changed and heightened by nonfinancial companies like Apple and Google.”\r\n\r\nJesse McWaters, global head of digital policy at Mastercard said that in 2014 most bank executives were skeptical of fintechs. Specifically, their ability to build consumer trust, to scale and for the new players to meet the regulatory requirements in the finance sector especially after the 2008 financial crisis.\r\n\r\nHowever, when he reconveyed a meeting a year later, he said the executives’ perspective changed remarkably.\r\n\r\n“When we brought that group together, only a year later in January of 2015, they had shifted from this, ‘complacency’, though not universally, to a palpable anxiety. That they were in for a serious fight, that they were going to need to be changes in the way that they ran their business. We\ve seen over the last five years, the results of that.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, financial service providers opted to collaborate with fintechs rather than compete with them.\r\n\r\nMcwaters gave the example of robo-advisors, which were brought into the mainstream by fintechs like Betterment and Wealthfront. It was however traditional financial services that were better able to fully utilise this new technology.\r\n\r\n“Ultimately, it hasn\t been Wealthfront or Betterment, who have been most successful at scaling up this model. It\s been the BlackRock or the Charles Schwabs’ of the world, the old guard who have taken those innovations, adopted and internalised them. They have used the existing capabilities that they have in terms of sales force and of pre-existing client relationships, to really drive those models up to full scale."

deploy fintech,https://finscend.com/why-banks-will-have-to-deploy-fintech-solutions/,4,"Why Banks Will Have to Deploy Fintech Solutions It used to be something that wasn’t mentioned in polite company, but those days are now over. Bank technology, especially the technology used to process credit card disputes, is outdated. It hasn’t been substantially upgraded for decades. And both banks and bank customers are suffering because of it. There are five major reasons why outdated banking technology has become a drag on traditional banks. First and foremost, perhaps, is the emergence of digital banking and challenger banks. These online alternatives are proving to be extremely popular with Millennials and Generation Z – whose business the veteran financial institutions will eventually have to attract in order to remain viable in the long run. Millennials and Gen Z, of course, are especially tech-savvy. Millennials were the first generation to have had internet access while in grammar school, and Gen Z is the first demographic to have been born after the invention of the smartphone. They are acculturated to do everything online on their pocket devices, and every study confirms, therefore, that they seek out alternatives to traditional businesses that require their physical presence at a particular location, especially when they have to wait before being able to get their business done. That’s bad news for big banks, since it’s typical for big banks. True, banks are culturally conservative. They don’t change long-established on a whim, especially technology. After all, millions and millions of files will have to migrate seamlessly from one platform to another. There is no room for failure. Which is why all big banks everywhere are now busy planning their all-digital future. The second reason is that fiat currency now faces competition from digital currencies. Unlike old-fashioned cash, cryptocurrency is acquired, held, traded, and spent outside of the traditional banking infrastructure. Combine that with the low percentage of Millennials and Gen Z who currently hold credit cards and their natural tendency to gravitate to digital solutions and banks face a major challenge. The planned launch of Libra, Facebook’s own cryptocurrency, will only intensify the competition. The third reason is alternative payment systems. And not just PayPal, the highly touted ApplePay and, of course, Amazon Payments and Google Wallet, but also Payoneer, Payza and Skrill, among others. These are user-friendly solutions for anyone with a smartphone, and not just Millennials and Gen Z. The fourth reason is that outdated technology is quickly becoming unaffordable. In comparison with other industries, which take advantage of new technological advances to increase automation and reduce operating expenses, the financial sector has slipped far behind. Ever-increasing operating expenses compromise the profitability of traditional banks in an increasingly competitive environment. Bank executives know that, and so do industry analysts who now address it in their reports. According to McKinsey, for example, the 15 largest American banks waste 3 billion annually on credit card dispute processing, which results from deficiencies in standardization, knowledge and software, not to mention substandard customer service. All of this brings us to the fifth and final reason why banks will have to grapple with their archaic technology and methodology: Fintech solutions are now reaching maturity. Banks are naturally cautious about making changes to their existing digital systems. But fintech incorporates new approaches – like artificial intelligence – that banks will be obliged to deploy to enable them to leapfrog ahead and thus compete and remain profitable in the long run. The World FinTech Report 2018, prepared by Capgemini and LinkedIn in cooperation with Efma, sums it up cogently: “Traditional financial institutions have a vast customer base and deep pockets, but with legacy systems holding them back.” Fintech will ensure that banks will no longer have to worry about that.

The development of digital transformation has also clearly triggered the emergence of fintech (financial technology) initiatives, which are recognized as some of the most important innovations in the financial industry. These initiatives are developing rapidly, driven in part by the sharing economy, regulations, and information technology. However, research in the field of fintech remains in its infancy.

This study aims to (1) determine the state of the art of financial technology research; (2) identify gaps in the financial technology research field; and (3) identify challenges and trends for future research potential. The novel proposal in this study includes theoretical contributions regarding financial technology. Using the systematic literature review approach of Kitchenham, in addition to thematic analysis, meta-analysis and observation to validate the quality of literature and analysis, the results of this study provide a theoretical basis fintech research from an information systems perspective, including the formulation of fintech technology concepts and their development."

fintech infrastructure innovative,https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Policy-Papers/Issues/2018/10/11/pp101118-bali-fintech-agenda,2,"Rapid advances in financial technology are transforming the economic and financial\nlandscape, offering wide-ranging opportunities while raising potential risks. Fintech can\nsupport potential growth and poverty reduction by strengthening financial\ndevelopment, inclusion, and efficiency—but it may pose risks to consumers and\ninvestors and, more broadly, to financial stability and integrity. \nNational authorities are keen to foster fintech’s potential benefits and to mitigate its\npossible risks. Many international and regional groupings are now examining various\naspects of fintech, in line with their respective mandates. There have been calls for\ngreater international cooperation and guidance about how to address emerging issues,\nwith some also cautioning against premature policy responses. \nIn response to these calls from member countries, the IMF and the World Bank staff\nhave developed the Bali Fintech Agenda, summarized in Annex I of this paper. The\nAgenda brings together and advances key issues for policymakers and the international\ncommunity to consider as individual countries formulate their policy approaches. It\ndistills these considerations into 12 elements arising from the experiences of member\ncountries.\nThe Agenda offers a framework for the consideration of high-level issues by individual\nmember countries, including in their own domestic policy discussions. It does not\nrepresent the work program of the IMF or the World Bank, nor does it aim to provide\nspecific guidance or policy advice. The Agenda will help guide the focus of IMF and\nWorld Bank staff in their work on fintech issues within their expertise and mandate,\ninform their dialogue with national authorities, and help shape their contributions to\nthe work of the standard-setting bodies and other relevant international institutions on\nfintech issues. Implications for the work programs of the IMF and World Bank will be\ndeveloped and presented to their respective Executive Boards for guidance as the\nnature and scope of the membership’s needs––in response to the Bali Fintech\nAgenda—become clearer., "

Venture capital investment is higher than ever, the infrastructure and hardware is becoming more prevalent and adoption levels, both among companies and consumers are finally gaining traction. Why is this? There are a number of factors making it a conducive climate for fintech. First of all there’s a genuine desire for innovation. The financial crisis did irreparable damage to the image of banks and traditional finance institutions. People want a change. The issue is the speed of change. Unlike other tech sectors, disruptive startups focusing on fintech won’t gain the trust of consumers or enterprises overnight. Although it almost appears as if fintech has suddenly exploded in 2014, it’s actually proved a gradual process to arrive at this tipping point. Alongside this genuine desire is a world well placed to embrace fintech in terms of devices and infrastructure. It’s not just the continuing growth in smartphones across the globe, there’s also the development of digital wallets and the evolution of mobile point-of-sale systems. Of course some challenges still remain. User adoption is not where many fintech companies would like it to be yet and regulation remains a barrier to change, but the disruption of a centuries-old industry is now well under way and will only continue in the coming years."

That is why the government continues to be focused on ensuring UK fintech succeeds.”\r\n\r\n“Crucial” review welcomed\r\n\r\nThe Kalifa Review was praised by UK fintechs, with Funding Options CEO, Simon Cureton saying in an email that it was a “good first step”.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, TransferGo CEO, Daumantas Dvilinskas said in an email: “The review provides crucial steps to demonstrating how the UK can continue to lead the fintech revolution. Like so many others we have chosen the UK as a base because we believe it has the talent, infrastructure and policies that will help fintechs thrive and build an inclusive community that equally supports businesses and the customers they serve.”\r\n\r\nNicki Bisgaard, CEO and founder of EedenBull, a global fintech payments company welcomed the review saying in an email that the five areas of recommendations “mirror our own journey and focus, and that of the growing fintech sector”.\r\n\r\nBisgaard added that a regulatory framework that was fit for the future would be crucial.\r\n\r\n“It is vitally important for the fintech sector to be given the freedom and support to innovate and grow, given how legacy, cumbersome regulation has hampered progress. It is critical that the industry embraces a new regulatory vision and framework in order to release the sector’s growth opportunities,” he said.\r\n\r\nAway from fintech, Accenture UK’s managing director in banking, Tom Graham said in an email that he hoped the review would “future-proof our unique ecosystem” and ensure the UK’s position as a global financial services leader is not diminished.\r\nMeanwhile Delloite’s head of fintech, Louise Brett said in a statement that the review represents a big bang moment for the sector and is an opportunity for the UK to ensure industry growth across the whole country, not just London.\r\n\r\nSpectre of Brexit looms \r\n\r\nHowever, the optimism around the review did not manage to overshadow the threat posed by Brexit and the pandemic to UK fintech.\r\n\r\nMike Laven CEO of Currencycloud said in an email that the recommendations are “necessary, but not sufficient”.\r\n\r\n“What the UK fintech industry really needs is both access to talent and easy access to global markets… Unfortunately, the fallout of Brexit and the pandemic have recently made this more difficult.\r\n\r\n“While we welcome growing the pipeline of homegrown talent and introducing skilled visas under the Kalifa Review, it will come to nothing if we can’t have equivalency to talent and markets that are available on our doorstep in Europe and globally,” Laven added.\r\n\r\nEchoing those sentiments, Charles Delingpole, founder and CEO of ComplyAdvantage said in an email: “The loss of passporting and the denial of equivalence for financial services is deeply problematic for UK fintech after Brexit.”\r\n\r\nJames Allum, Payoneer’s VP and head of Europe, added his name to the list of those calling for better relations with other nations, saying in an email it was “essential” that the UK retained open borders and a system of international equivalence.\r\n\r\nChancellor Rishi Sunak MP said in a statement on the release of the report: “This review will make an important contribution to our plan to retain the UK’s fintech crown, create more skilled jobs, and deliver better financial services for people and businesses.”\r\n\r\nHowever, the government refused to answer questions on how they would overcome Brexit-related issues on passporting, equivalence and access to talent that market participants said were scuppering the future of UK fintech.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
