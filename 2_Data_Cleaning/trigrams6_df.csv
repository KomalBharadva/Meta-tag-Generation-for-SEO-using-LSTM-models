This year’s Fintech 250 represents 25 countries and spans 19 categories—reimagining everything from retail banking and crypto, to insurance and asset management,” said CB Insights CEO Anand Sanwal. “The previous Fintech 250 class raised more than $22 billion in investor financing and saw more than 20 exits after being recognized, and we expect this year’s class will have similar success as they continue to transform how people and businesses spend, save, borrow and invest their money.”“It’s truly an honor to be recognized by CB Insights alongside so many incredible fintech companies, particularly in a year when fintech is playing an integral role in softening the economic blow of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Brock Blake, CEO and co-founder of Lendio. “Lendio’s high-tech, consultative approach to small business financing has enabled our team to assist more than 100,000 small business owners during their most vulnerable time. The last five months have proved to be among the most challenging yet rewarding times for all of us at Lendio.”Through an evidence-based approach, the CB Insights Intelligence Unit selected the Fintech 250 from a pool of 16,000 companies, including applicants and nominees, based on several factors. These factors include patent activity, investor quality, news sentiment analysis, proprietary Mosaic scores, market potential, partnerships, competitive landscape, team strength and tech novelty. The Mosaic Score, based on CB Insights’ algorithm, measures the overall health and growth potential of private companies to help predict a company’s momentum.Lendio prides itself on being a small business advocate, connecting business owners with the capital they need to operate and grow. With loan options from hundreds of the nation’s leading online lenders, banks and industry specialty lenders, Lendio is a one-stop-shop for thousands of business owners looking for funds. To-date, Lendio has facilitated over $10B in financing through more than 200,000 small business loans, including 100,000 Paycheck Protection Program loans—funds allocated for small business relief as part of the CARES Act.2020 Fintech 250 Highlights:  * Unicorns: 32 of the 250 companies are valued at or above $1B as of their latest funding round.   * Funding trends: YTD, these 250 private companies have raised $10.3B in equity funding across 120 deals (as of 8/26/20). Lendio secured a $55M series E round in February 2020.   * Mega-rounds: Since 2019, there have been 87 mega-round ($100M+) equity investments to this year’s Fintech 250, with 35 of them in 2020 YTD (as of 8/25/20).   * Global representation: 46% of the 2020 Fintech 250 are based outside the US. After the US, the UK is home to the most Fintech 250 companies (38), followed by India (20).

Venture capital investment is higher than ever, the infrastructure and hardware is becoming more prevalent and adoption levels, both among companies and consumers are finally gaining traction. Why is this? There are a number of factors making it a conducive climate for fintech. First of all there’s a genuine desire for innovation. The financial crisis did irreparable damage to the image of banks and traditional finance institutions. People want a change. The issue is the speed of change. Unlike other tech sectors, disruptive startups focusing on fintech won’t gain the trust of consumers or enterprises overnight. Although it almost appears as if fintech has suddenly exploded in 2014, it’s actually proved a gradual process to arrive at this tipping point. Alongside this genuine desire is a world well placed to embrace fintech in terms of devices and infrastructure. It’s not just the continuing growth in smartphones across the globe, there’s also the development of digital wallets and the evolution of mobile point-of-sale systems. Of course some challenges still remain. User adoption is not where many fintech companies would like it to be yet and regulation remains a barrier to change, but the disruption of a centuries-old industry is now well under way and will only continue in the coming years.']"

fintech digitization earn,https://www.bobsguide.com/guide/news/2020/Dec/21/risk-rise-in-pandemic-hit-fintech-sector/,3,"['Risk rise in pandemic-hit fintech sector', '\r\n\r\nThe most immediate disruptive threat, although not the biggest, is clearly Brexit because of a welter of regulatory obligations. When UK finally and irrevocably leaves the EU on December 31, it will introduce even more complications for the finance sector\r\nin general and payment service providers (PSPs) in particular.\r\n\r\nThere’s considerable potential for disruption during the transition period in terms of processing payments as UK firms phase in regulatory changes. The authorities will be watching closely. “We expect UK PSPs to have effective risk-based procedures that apply where the transfer of payment lacks the information needed on the payer or the payee,” warns the Prudential Regulation Authority.\r\n\r\nFirms will have to be on the ball in the weeks and months after Brexit. “If any payments are disrupted, we expect firms to communicate promptly with any affected customers….and give them the opportunity to make the payment in another way,” says the PRA.\r\n\r\nBut the most pressing risk is cyber attacks. If there is one issue that strikes at the heart of all firms having custody client funds, it’s security of client’s money, identity and other personal details.\r\n\r\nAs Mastercard reports, fintech is the biggest target of cyber attacks after healthcare. And too many fintech firms are vulnerable. Research by ImmuniWeb, an application security group, has found that 98 percent of the biggest global fintech startups are vulnerable to major cyber attacks. In 2019 the industry saw a 480 percent increase in the number of cyber attacks on regulated financial services companies, according to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), most of them from phishing, ransomware and data leakage.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of attacks has forced the International Monetary Fund to conclude that they amount to a full-on threat to financial stability. “As we become increasingly reliant on digital financial services, the number of cyber attacks has tripled over the last decade, and financial services continue to be the most targeted industry. Cyber security has clearly become a threat to financial stability,” the organisation concludes in a blog in December. “Given strong financial and technological interconnections, a successful attack on a major financial institution, or on a core system or service used by many, could quickly spread through the entire financial system causing widespread disruption and loss of confidence.”\r\n\r\nAnd as the cost of hacking tools collapses and more bad actors get involved, the risks mount. “In our view many national financial systems are not yet ready to manage attacks while international coordination is still weak,” warns the IMF.\r\n\r\nBut management has not yet risen to the challenge either. The pandemic has increased cyber risk because more staff are working remotely, notes cloud security specialist Trend Micro. “Home networks, remote working software and cloud systems will be at the centre of a new wave of attacks in 2021,” it predicts in its latest report Turning the Tide. “Cyber-criminals will particularly look to home networks as a critical launch pad to compromise corporate IT and IoT networks.”\r\n\r\nThe main targets will be anybody who regularly accesses sensitive data such as sales managers holding information about customers and senior executives managing confidential company numbers. Also application programming interfaces (APIs), one of the most important tools of the fintech sector, will come under fire, predicts Trend Micro. “As third-party integrations reign, exposed APIs will become a new preferred attack vector for cyber-criminals, providing access to sensitive customer data, source code and back-end services.\r\n\r\nIn the long run artificial intelligence may come to the rescue by blocking all unauthorised access, but security experts say the looming prospect of a wave of attacks will force firms to invest heavily in training, especially of remote workers, as well as in systems that improve detection and response rates around the clock.\r\n\r\nBy common consent home working has greatly increased the risk of losing vital data. Yet, notes Ireland’s advisory and accounting firm HLB Sheehan Quinn in its 2020 cyber security report, more than half of organisations said their security procedures were not designed for remote working.\r\n\r\nSustainability \r\nA much softer but by no means insubstantial risk arises in investors’ insistence on a culture of sustainability. Put another way, firms that aren’t seen as sustainable will lose potential and actual clients.\r\n\r\nClimate-friendly behaviour is no longer optional as regulations steadily tighten, like the EU’s imminent rules on sustainable finance (SDFR). “Sustainability and responsible investment are becoming mainstream priorities for pension funds, insurers and other investors,” explains Melville Rodrigues, senior consultant for funds services in Ocorian, a specialist in fiduciary services, fund administration and capital markets, in a briefing in December. “Managers are responding with fund products that look to meet these priorities.”\r\n\r\nAnd the obligations are onerous, applying from March 2021 to all products marketed into the EU including from non-EU managers. Rodrigues adds: “The SFDR requires fund managers, such as those operating as alternative investment fund managers (AIFMs), to disclose how they have integrated in their processes, including in their due diligence, an assessment of all relevant sustainability risks that might have a material negative impact on the financial return of a fund investment.”\r\n\r\nBrexit won’t make things any easier. The UK government has already announced it will implement mandatory climate-related financial disclosures right across the economy by 2025 at the latest, but many disclosure obligations will come into force by 2023.\r\nThis is a bottom-line issue for investors who watch firms’ credentials closely. Indeed rating agency Scope has started ranking stock exchanges on the average environmental impact of their component stocks.\r\n\r\n“Our assessment of environmental, social and governance impacts acts like an early warning system for portfolio managers, showing where future regulatory risks and associated costs lie through the analysis of today’s impacts by factor, sector and geography,” said head of ESG Diane Menville in mid-December. Incidentally, also in December France’s CAC40 index scored higher than Germany’s DAX30. “In ESG impact CAC40 has a greener global footprint than DAX30,” notes Scope, putting the former at 6.5 out of a perfect 10 compared with the latter’s 6.3.\r\n\r\nLobby groups are watching too. In mid-December UK-based Make My Money Matter gave a pat on the back to the mighty New York State Pension Fund with $193.4bn under management after it promised to sell shares in companies, mainly oil and gas, by 2040 if they are still contributing to global warming. Meantime Make My Money Matter is lobbying the UK government to require all pension funds to report on their emissions projections up to 2050 and align their portfolios with the Paris Agreement.\r\n\r\nInvestment firms are rapidly waking up to the risks of climate-hostile actions. Luxembourg-based investment manager Lombard Odier is one that has committed to a “bio-friendly” philosophy built around the CLIC economy, standing for circular, lean, inclusive and clean. It’s a new world in investment, say portfolio manager Alina Donets and head of CLIC Kristina Church. “Global businesses already recognise the need for transformation toward circular and lean operating models,” they explain in a paper released in December.\r\n\r\nThis is seen as virtuous and profitable. Lombard Odier has identified 550 bio-friendly companies, mostly small and mid-cap, that offer “superior growth profiles and excess economic returns, combined with solid ESG credentials including assessment of any controversies.”\r\n\r\nFrench neo-insurer Luko could be the new model. The home insurance specialist, which has just raised €50m in a second round of funding, has grown six times since its launch in 2018 on the back of the kind of ethical behaviour that increasingly attracts customers. At the end of every financial year the insurtech, boasting 100,000 clients, hands to charities any premiums in the pool that haven’t been used to refund claims. The policyholders choose the charities.\r\n\r\nKeeping up\r\nIn a fast-developing industry based on high technology, firms that fail to keep up will suffer, for instance in cross-border payments. As the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) pointed out in a report in August, cross-border payments are generally “slower, more expensive, less transparent and less accessible than domestic payments.” Consequently, the G20 has made them a top priority and has asked the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to address systemic issues.\r\n\r\nAs a report by America’s Association for Financial Professionals makes clear, this will necessarily involve investment, planning and technology. Citing the importance of “operational improvements that can be made to domestic and international payment infrastructures,” notes the association in November, the FSB sees opportunities to reduce problems caused by different operating hours, long transaction chains, high funding costs, access regimes, and weak competition.”\r\n\r\nThe pandemic has made reforms more urgent. As the association notes, the BIS believes that the crisis has “amplified calls to reinforce coordination and reduce fragmentation in cross-border payment systems.”\r\n\r\nAnd that may increase competition in a shrunken, pandemic-hit market. As McKinsey & Co has calculated, global payments revenue will probably fall by seven per cent – equivalent to $170bn – in 2020. And the established institutions are fighting back. Working with more than 20 banks, SWIFT is expanding into lower-value transfers for SMEs and consumers with fewer friction points in what it calls “predictable payments”.\r\n\r\nIn this market there are only the quick and the']"

That is why the government continues to be focused on ensuring UK fintech succeeds.”\r\n\r\n“Crucial” review welcomed\r\n\r\nThe Kalifa Review was praised by UK fintechs, with Funding Options CEO, Simon Cureton saying in an email that it was a “good first step”.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, TransferGo CEO, Daumantas Dvilinskas said in an email: “The review provides crucial steps to demonstrating how the UK can continue to lead the fintech revolution. Like so many others we have chosen the UK as a base because we believe it has the talent, infrastructure and policies that will help fintechs thrive and build an inclusive community that equally supports businesses and the customers they serve.”\r\n\r\nNicki Bisgaard, CEO and founder of EedenBull, a global fintech payments company welcomed the review saying in an email that the five areas of recommendations “mirror our own journey and focus, and that of the growing fintech sector”.\r\n\r\nBisgaard added that a regulatory framework that was fit for the future would be crucial.\r\n\r\n“It is vitally important for the fintech sector to be given the freedom and support to innovate and grow, given how legacy, cumbersome regulation has hampered progress. It is critical that the industry embraces a new regulatory vision and framework in order to release the sector’s growth opportunities,” he said.\r\n\r\nAway from fintech, Accenture UK’s managing director in banking, Tom Graham said in an email that he hoped the review would “future-proof our unique ecosystem” and ensure the UK’s position as a global financial services leader is not diminished.\r\nMeanwhile Delloite’s head of fintech, Louise Brett said in a statement that the review represents a big bang moment for the sector and is an opportunity for the UK to ensure industry growth across the whole country, not just London.\r\n\r\nSpectre of Brexit looms \r\n\r\nHowever, the optimism around the review did not manage to overshadow the threat posed by Brexit and the pandemic to UK fintech.\r\n\r\nMike Laven CEO of Currencycloud said in an email that the recommendations are “necessary, but not sufficient”.\r\n\r\n“What the UK fintech industry really needs is both access to talent and easy access to global markets… Unfortunately, the fallout of Brexit and the pandemic have recently made this more difficult.\r\n\r\n“While we welcome growing the pipeline of homegrown talent and introducing skilled visas under the Kalifa Review, it will come to nothing if we can’t have equivalency to talent and markets that are available on our doorstep in Europe and globally,” Laven added.\r\n\r\nEchoing those sentiments, Charles Delingpole, founder and CEO of ComplyAdvantage said in an email: “The loss of passporting and the denial of equivalence for financial services is deeply problematic for UK fintech after Brexit.”\r\n\r\nJames Allum, Payoneer’s VP and head of Europe, added his name to the list of those calling for better relations with other nations, saying in an email it was “essential” that the UK retained open borders and a system of international equivalence.\r\n\r\nChancellor Rishi Sunak MP said in a statement on the release of the report: “This review will make an important contribution to our plan to retain the UK’s fintech crown, create more skilled jobs, and deliver better financial services for people and businesses.”\r\n\r\nHowever, the government refused to answer questions on how they would overcome Brexit-related issues on passporting, equivalence and access to talent that market participants said were scuppering the future of UK fintech.\r\n\r\n\r\n""]"

fintech example dollar,https://www.bobsguide.com/guide/news/2020/Jun/4/uk-fintech-investment-up-500-percent-in-five-years/,9,"['UK fintech investment up 500 percent in five years', '\r\n\r\nA recent\xa0report has also found that UK fintechs received the greatest amount of investment of all European fintechs, pulling in $48bn (£38bn) in 2019.\r\n\r\nThis uptick is expected to continue, as London-based fintechs generated $114m of investment during Q1 2020—only $34m less than during 2017.\r\n\r\nThis may be good news for a post-Brexit UK, as the report also noted that over 1,000 EU-based firms are planning to establish their first UK office after Brexit.\r\n\r\n“I expect a lot of smaller fintechs will be absorbed or bought up within the 18 months to two year horizon, because they won’t be able to continue independently, and they won’t really get some sort of further rounds of funding if they’re not directly in that in the path of mainstream digitsation,” said James Buckley, vice president and head of Finacle Europe, Infosys.\r\n\r\nAs the UK leaves the EU’s collaborative network, national governments may create more incentives for local and regional fintech development. While Q1 2020 venture capital deals over $1m fell in the UK and US, Europe saw an uptick in investments, according to the report.\r\n\r\nThat said, London’s Silicon Roundabout is still expected to become a magnet for investment over the next three to six months. However, Buckley expects the coronavirus-led lack of face-to-face contact to impact the medium-term growth of fintechs.\r\n\r\nThe report also found that since 2017, technology roles within the UK banking industry have risen 50 percent in Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, and 23 percent within London.\r\n\r\nHowever, the industry firmly remains London-focused, where tech vacancies on the whole have risen by 31 percent since 2017. Of the 96 fintech investments made in 2019, only eight were put into regional businesses, highlighting a dissonance within the UK.\r\n\r\nWhile this is an improvement over the five regional investments made in 2018, the report suggests that London will remain the UK’s fintech capital for the immediate future, even after Brexit.\r\n\r\n“If the government are serious about levelling up the country to catch up with London, then serious thought needs to be given to how and why London-based businesses remain so much more attractive to VC,” Ahsan Iqbal, director of technology (regions) at Robert Walters, said in the report.\r\n\r\nAlthough the report highlighted intense growth in the industry, coronavirus has changed how many financial institutions operate and provide their services. While the UK saw a 73 percent adoption of online banking in 2019, this is expected to increase as a direct result of global lockdown measures.\r\n\r\n“There’s a whole fintech ecosystem that sits around digital processes, and those fintechs that are relevant to putting together digital processes are going to benefit enormously in the next 24 months, because they’re going to be in massive demand,” Buckley said.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the report suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) and lending-focused firms will be best placed to weather coronavirus’ impact. Sudheesh Nair, CEO of ThoughtSpot, said via email that even with the constant market and technology flux, firms which offer data-led services will likely see increasing marginal gains.\r\n\r\n“We don’t anticipate AI growth to slow – it’s a key driver of better outcomes in the financial markets across businesses functions and it can even specifically help frontline workers get answers and better results for customers immediately where it’s most needed,” Nair said.']"

While Q1 2020 venture capital deals over $1m fell in the UK and US, Europe saw an uptick in investments, according to the report.\r\n\r\nThat said, London’s Silicon Roundabout is still expected to become a magnet for investment over the next three to six months. However, Buckley expects the coronavirus-led lack of face-to-face contact to impact the medium-term growth of fintechs.\r\n\r\nThe report also found that since 2017, technology roles within the UK banking industry have risen 50 percent in Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, and 23 percent within London.\r\n\r\nHowever, the industry firmly remains London-focused, where tech vacancies on the whole have risen by 31 percent since 2017. Of the 96 fintech investments made in 2019, only eight were put into regional businesses, highlighting a dissonance within the UK.\r\n\r\nWhile this is an improvement over the five regional investments made in 2018, the report suggests that London will remain the UK’s fintech capital for the immediate future, even after Brexit.\r\n\r\n“If the government are serious about levelling up the country to catch up with London, then serious thought needs to be given to how and why London-based businesses remain so much more attractive to VC,” Ahsan Iqbal, director of technology (regions) at Robert Walters, said in the report.\r\n\r\nAlthough the report highlighted intense growth in the industry, coronavirus has changed how many financial institutions operate and provide their services. While the UK saw a 73 percent adoption of online banking in 2019, this is expected to increase as a direct result of global lockdown measures.\r\n\r\n“There’s a whole fintech ecosystem that sits around digital processes, and those fintechs that are relevant to putting together digital processes are going to benefit enormously in the next 24 months, because they’re going to be in massive demand,” Buckley said.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the report suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) and lending-focused firms will be best placed to weather coronavirus’ impact. Sudheesh Nair, CEO of ThoughtSpot, said via email that even with the constant market and technology flux, firms which offer data-led services will likely see increasing marginal gains.\r\n\r\n“We don’t anticipate AI growth to slow – it’s a key driver of better outcomes in the financial markets across businesses functions and it can even specifically help frontline workers get answers and better results for customers immediately where it’s most needed,” Nair said.']"
