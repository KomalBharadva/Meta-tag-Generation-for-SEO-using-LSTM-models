It is mainly used to refer to firms that use technology-based systems either to provide financial services and products directly, or to try to make the financial system more efficient. Examples include robotic trading, cashless payments, crowdfunding platforms, robo-advice, and virtual currencies. The value of global FinTech investment in 2015 grew by 75 % to US$22.3 billion. Corporates, venture capital and private equity firms have invested more than US$50 billion in almost 2 500 global FinTech start-ups since 2010.\nThe rapidly growing FinTech sector has its rewards and challenges (e.g. data and consumer protection issues, risk of exacerbating financial volatility and cybercrime) and is increasingly attracting political attention. The European Commission set up a Financial Technology Task Force (FTTF), and the European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee (ECON) presented its draft report on FinTech in January 2017. At G20 level, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) will present its study scrutinising FinTech in July 2017.\nDue to the broad scope of FinTech, regulators can face a dilemma: rule-based regulatory frameworks set out compliance obligations clearly, but these are often expensive from a start-up perspective and could be an obstacle to innovation and job creation; principle-based regulation is more flexible, but could create some uncertainty as to what exactly is expected in terms of compliance.', 'european parliament, parliament, europe']"

fintech attack still,https://www.bobsguide.com/guide/news/2020/Dec/21/risk-rise-in-pandemic-hit-fintech-sector/,1,"['Risk rise in pandemic-hit fintech sector', '\r\n\r\nThe most immediate disruptive threat, although not the biggest, is clearly Brexit because of a welter of regulatory obligations. When UK finally and irrevocably leaves the EU on December 31, it will introduce even more complications for the finance sector\r\nin general and payment service providers (PSPs) in particular.\r\n\r\nThere’s considerable potential for disruption during the transition period in terms of processing payments as UK firms phase in regulatory changes. The authorities will be watching closely. “We expect UK PSPs to have effective risk-based procedures that apply where the transfer of payment lacks the information needed on the payer or the payee,” warns the Prudential Regulation Authority.\r\n\r\nFirms will have to be on the ball in the weeks and months after Brexit. “If any payments are disrupted, we expect firms to communicate promptly with any affected customers….and give them the opportunity to make the payment in another way,” says the PRA.\r\n\r\nBut the most pressing risk is cyber attacks. If there is one issue that strikes at the heart of all firms having custody client funds, it’s security of client’s money, identity and other personal details.\r\n\r\nAs Mastercard reports, fintech is the biggest target of cyber attacks after healthcare. And too many fintech firms are vulnerable. Research by ImmuniWeb, an application security group, has found that 98 percent of the biggest global fintech startups are vulnerable to major cyber attacks. In 2019 the industry saw a 480 percent increase in the number of cyber attacks on regulated financial services companies, according to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), most of them from phishing, ransomware and data leakage.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of attacks has forced the International Monetary Fund to conclude that they amount to a full-on threat to financial stability. “As we become increasingly reliant on digital financial services, the number of cyber attacks has tripled over the last decade, and financial services continue to be the most targeted industry. Cyber security has clearly become a threat to financial stability,” the organisation concludes in a blog in December. “Given strong financial and technological interconnections, a successful attack on a major financial institution, or on a core system or service used by many, could quickly spread through the entire financial system causing widespread disruption and loss of confidence.”\r\n\r\nAnd as the cost of hacking tools collapses and more bad actors get involved, the risks mount. “In our view many national financial systems are not yet ready to manage attacks while international coordination is still weak,” warns the IMF.\r\n\r\nBut management has not yet risen to the challenge either. The pandemic has increased cyber risk because more staff are working remotely, notes cloud security specialist Trend Micro. “Home networks, remote working software and cloud systems will be at the centre of a new wave of attacks in 2021,” it predicts in its latest report Turning the Tide. “Cyber-criminals will particularly look to home networks as a critical launch pad to compromise corporate IT and IoT networks.”\r\n\r\nThe main targets will be anybody who regularly accesses sensitive data such as sales managers holding information about customers and senior executives managing confidential company numbers. Also application programming interfaces (APIs), one of the most important tools of the fintech sector, will come under fire, predicts Trend Micro. “As third-party integrations reign, exposed APIs will become a new preferred attack vector for cyber-criminals, providing access to sensitive customer data, source code and back-end services.\r\n\r\nIn the long run artificial intelligence may come to the rescue by blocking all unauthorised access, but security experts say the looming prospect of a wave of attacks will force firms to invest heavily in training, especially of remote workers, as well as in systems that improve detection and response rates around the clock.\r\n\r\nBy common consent home working has greatly increased the risk of losing vital data. Yet, notes Ireland’s advisory and accounting firm HLB Sheehan Quinn in its 2020 cyber security report, more than half of organisations said their security procedures were not designed for remote working.\r\n\r\nSustainability \r\nA much softer but by no means insubstantial risk arises in investors’ insistence on a culture of sustainability. Put another way, firms that aren’t seen as sustainable will lose potential and actual clients.\r\n\r\nClimate-friendly behaviour is no longer optional as regulations steadily tighten, like the EU’s imminent rules on sustainable finance (SDFR). “Sustainability and responsible investment are becoming mainstream priorities for pension funds, insurers and other investors,” explains Melville Rodrigues, senior consultant for funds services in Ocorian, a specialist in fiduciary services, fund administration and capital markets, in a briefing in December. “Managers are responding with fund products that look to meet these priorities.”\r\n\r\nAnd the obligations are onerous, applying from March 2021 to all products marketed into the EU including from non-EU managers. Rodrigues adds: “The SFDR requires fund managers, such as those operating as alternative investment fund managers (AIFMs), to disclose how they have integrated in their processes, including in their due diligence, an assessment of all relevant sustainability risks that might have a material negative impact on the financial return of a fund investment.”\r\n\r\nBrexit won’t make things any easier. The UK government has already announced it will implement mandatory climate-related financial disclosures right across the economy by 2025 at the latest, but many disclosure obligations will come into force by 2023.\r\nThis is a bottom-line issue for investors who watch firms’ credentials closely. Indeed rating agency Scope has started ranking stock exchanges on the average environmental impact of their component stocks.\r\n\r\n“Our assessment of environmental, social and governance impacts acts like an early warning system for portfolio managers, showing where future regulatory risks and associated costs lie through the analysis of today’s impacts by factor, sector and geography,” said head of ESG Diane Menville in mid-December. Incidentally, also in December France’s CAC40 index scored higher than Germany’s DAX30. “In ESG impact CAC40 has a greener global footprint than DAX30,” notes Scope, putting the former at 6.5 out of a perfect 10 compared with the latter’s 6.3.\r\n\r\nLobby groups are watching too. In mid-December UK-based Make My Money Matter gave a pat on the back to the mighty New York State Pension Fund with $193.4bn under management after it promised to sell shares in companies, mainly oil and gas, by 2040 if they are still contributing to global warming. Meantime Make My Money Matter is lobbying the UK government to require all pension funds to report on their emissions projections up to 2050 and align their portfolios with the Paris Agreement.\r\n\r\nInvestment firms are rapidly waking up to the risks of climate-hostile actions. Luxembourg-based investment manager Lombard Odier is one that has committed to a “bio-friendly” philosophy built around the CLIC economy, standing for circular, lean, inclusive and clean. It’s a new world in investment, say portfolio manager Alina Donets and head of CLIC Kristina Church. “Global businesses already recognise the need for transformation toward circular and lean operating models,” they explain in a paper released in December.\r\n\r\nThis is seen as virtuous and profitable. Lombard Odier has identified 550 bio-friendly companies, mostly small and mid-cap, that offer “superior growth profiles and excess economic returns, combined with solid ESG credentials including assessment of any controversies.”\r\n\r\nFrench neo-insurer Luko could be the new model. The home insurance specialist, which has just raised €50m in a second round of funding, has grown six times since its launch in 2018 on the back of the kind of ethical behaviour that increasingly attracts customers. At the end of every financial year the insurtech, boasting 100,000 clients, hands to charities any premiums in the pool that haven’t been used to refund claims. The policyholders choose the charities.\r\n\r\nKeeping up\r\nIn a fast-developing industry based on high technology, firms that fail to keep up will suffer, for instance in cross-border payments. As the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) pointed out in a report in August, cross-border payments are generally “slower, more expensive, less transparent and less accessible than domestic payments.” Consequently, the G20 has made them a top priority and has asked the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to address systemic issues.\r\n\r\nAs a report by America’s Association for Financial Professionals makes clear, this will necessarily involve investment, planning and technology. Citing the importance of “operational improvements that can be made to domestic and international payment infrastructures,” notes the association in November, the FSB sees opportunities to reduce problems caused by different operating hours, long transaction chains, high funding costs, access regimes, and weak competition.”\r\n\r\nThe pandemic has made reforms more urgent. As the association notes, the BIS believes that the crisis has “amplified calls to reinforce coordination and reduce fragmentation in cross-border payment systems.”\r\n\r\nAnd that may increase competition in a shrunken, pandemic-hit market. As McKinsey & Co has calculated, global payments revenue will probably fall by seven per cent – equivalent to $170bn – in 2020. And the established institutions are fighting back. Working with more than 20 banks, SWIFT is expanding into lower-value transfers for SMEs and consumers with fewer friction points in what it calls “predictable payments”.\r\n\r\nIn this market there are only the quick and the']"

fintech commissioned hack,https://www.bobsguide.com/guide/news/2020/Dec/4/the-complexities-of-creating-fintech-and-how-to-overcome-them/,1,"['The complexities of creating fintech and how to overcome them', '\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest changes to come from the coronavirus pandemic is the effect it’s had on consumers’ expectations. The increased reliance on digital solutions has, in turn, opened people’s eyes to the convenience (or inconvenience) of managing their financial affairs online.\r\n\r\nYobota recently commissioned a survey of over 2,000 UK adults to explore how satisfied customers are with their banks in 2020. The majority (58 percent) said they want more power to renegotiate or change their accounts or products, with a third (33 percent) expressing frustrations at having to choose from generic, off-the-shelf financial products.\r\n\r\nDemand for greater control and more flexible, personalised products is on the rise. These demands can be met, but only if financial institutions and technology vendors are progressive in the development and application of fintech.\r\n\r\nWhether banks build it or buy it, there is a fundamental need to understand how fintech is created. And, moreover, how to do it well.\r\n\r\nAddressing the regulation barrier\r\n\r\nFinance, and by extension fintech, is a heavily regulated industry. A fintech creator’s ability to navigate the regulatory landscape and ensure it remains compliant with all the necessary checks is key to winning the confidence of the public, as well as potential clients and partners.\r\n\r\nOften, a huge volume of work is required. Rules can change over time (even temporarily, as we have seen in some cases this year), and there’s always room for interpretation in the principle-based regulatory approach.\r\n\r\nHaving a team of compliance experts on board is crucial to effectively handle any regulatory demands, particularly as the business scales – both in terms of its user base, and as it crosses borders into new regulatory environments.\r\n\r\nBusinesses must always remain forthcoming and transparent about the steps they are taking to protect the consumer, and consequently the reputation of their business partner(s).\r\n\r\nWhat problem are you solving, and who are you solving it for?\r\n\r\nIt is easy to overlook the basics when you set out to bring a new product to market and instead get bogged down in developing features. I would encourage vendors to take a step back and consider the bigger picture before delving into the technical aspects of product development.\r\n\r\nWhat challenge are you going to solve first? Is it an issue related to payment infrastructure, insurance, or investment management? Fintech is an incredibly broad industry, so it’s important to be clear on your goals. Are you going to improve or replace something that already exists, or are you looking to bring something entirely new to the market? These are all questions that should be asked in the very initial stages of development.\r\n\r\nFeatures are important, but they are often a secondary reason a customer will buy or use a product. So, it’s important that your offering provides a valuable solution to a very specific problem before worrying about the finer details.\r\n\r\nTo that end, knowing your client is crucial. Product and engineering teams need to have a clear focus as to their end goal and have a strong understanding of who they are building the product for.\r\n\r\nA technology vendor must be specific and strategic when it comes to pursuing the right clients (a particular type of financial services firm, for instance), while also keeping in mind the cultural fit between their team and prospective partners. Ensuring there is a mutual understanding of what the overall vision is and how it will be achieved – including the practical implementation, timeline and costs – will establish a strong foundation for the business-to-business relationship.\r\n\r\nAligning the best technology with best practice\r\n\r\nMeaningful digital transformation is achieved when the best technology aligns with best practice. Developers must resist the urge to jump on the latest technology trends, which might, at best, increase the cost of development or, at worst, significantly set back progress.\r\n\r\nEffective innovation ultimately comes from creating a stronger value proposition for clients. If exciting new architectures or programming languages don’t achieve this, then it is best to leave them out of the equation.\r\n\r\nFintech needs to be created in modern ways, with proven foundational principles in mind. Engineers must be certain their product will remain relevant and valuable for years to come, even if they are no longer there to support it.\r\n\r\nThe end user is key\r\n\r\nThe coronavirus pandemic has made it patently clear that the most successful finance companies are those that have formed partnerships to create technology which can be used seamlessly between separate banking products and accounts. Yobota’s aforementioned research is evidence of that; banking customers are becoming increasingly frustrated with inflexible products and services.\r\n\r\nThe quality and functionality of digital solutions is going to remain of utmost importance going forward. Once people have a taste for the speed, ease and convenience of being able to manage their finance affairs digitally, they will not settle for a return to in-branch meetings, lengthy telephone calls or slow exchanges of paperwork.\r\n\r\nThat is why the voice of the customer must always drive development roadmaps. After all, the happiness of the end user is the strongest indication of success.\r\n\r\nFintechs must consider how they can deftly leverage new and advancing technology to continue to make the customer experience even better, while also improving their underlying product. Interoperability – the ease of integration with other providers – is also an important consideration to bear in mind.\r\n\r\nProgressive fintech promotes partnerships and interoperability to reduce the roadblocks that customers encounter – and it will find innovative ways to bring all of these services into one product.\r\n\r\nThe success of finance companies in the months ahead will, in no small part, be determined by their ability to keep pace with the technological change that is taking place.

We examine the impact of the funding of such start-ups on the stock returns of 47 incumbent US retail banks for 2010 to 2016. To capture the importance of FinTech start-ups, we use data on both the dollar-volume of funding and number of deals. We relate these to the stock returns with panel data regression methods. Our results indicate a positive relationship exists between the growth in FinTech funding or deals and the contemporaneous stock returns of incumbent retail banks. Although these results suggest complementarity between FinTech and traditional banking, we note that our results at the banking industry level are not statistically significant, and that the coefficient signs for about one-third of the banks are negative, but not statistically significant. Since the FinTech industry is young and our sample period short, we cannot rule out that our findings are spurious.']"

fintech developed clear,https://www.bobsguide.com/guide/news/2020/Dec/4/the-complexities-of-creating-fintech-and-how-to-overcome-them/,7,"['The complexities of creating fintech and how to overcome them', '\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest changes to come from the coronavirus pandemic is the effect it’s had on consumers’ expectations. The increased reliance on digital solutions has, in turn, opened people’s eyes to the convenience (or inconvenience) of managing their financial affairs online.\r\n\r\nYobota recently commissioned a survey of over 2,000 UK adults to explore how satisfied customers are with their banks in 2020. The majority (58 percent) said they want more power to renegotiate or change their accounts or products, with a third (33 percent) expressing frustrations at having to choose from generic, off-the-shelf financial products.\r\n\r\nDemand for greater control and more flexible, personalised products is on the rise. These demands can be met, but only if financial institutions and technology vendors are progressive in the development and application of fintech.\r\n\r\nWhether banks build it or buy it, there is a fundamental need to understand how fintech is created. And, moreover, how to do it well.\r\n\r\nAddressing the regulation barrier\r\n\r\nFinance, and by extension fintech, is a heavily regulated industry. A fintech creator’s ability to navigate the regulatory landscape and ensure it remains compliant with all the necessary checks is key to winning the confidence of the public, as well as potential clients and partners.\r\n\r\nOften, a huge volume of work is required. Rules can change over time (even temporarily, as we have seen in some cases this year), and there’s always room for interpretation in the principle-based regulatory approach.\r\n\r\nHaving a team of compliance experts on board is crucial to effectively handle any regulatory demands, particularly as the business scales – both in terms of its user base, and as it crosses borders into new regulatory environments.\r\n\r\nBusinesses must always remain forthcoming and transparent about the steps they are taking to protect the consumer, and consequently the reputation of their business partner(s).\r\n\r\nWhat problem are you solving, and who are you solving it for?\r\n\r\nIt is easy to overlook the basics when you set out to bring a new product to market and instead get bogged down in developing features. I would encourage vendors to take a step back and consider the bigger picture before delving into the technical aspects of product development.\r\n\r\nWhat challenge are you going to solve first? Is it an issue related to payment infrastructure, insurance, or investment management? Fintech is an incredibly broad industry, so it’s important to be clear on your goals. Are you going to improve or replace something that already exists, or are you looking to bring something entirely new to the market? These are all questions that should be asked in the very initial stages of development.\r\n\r\nFeatures are important, but they are often a secondary reason a customer will buy or use a product. So, it’s important that your offering provides a valuable solution to a very specific problem before worrying about the finer details.\r\n\r\nTo that end, knowing your client is crucial. Product and engineering teams need to have a clear focus as to their end goal and have a strong understanding of who they are building the product for.\r\n\r\nA technology vendor must be specific and strategic when it comes to pursuing the right clients (a particular type of financial services firm, for instance), while also keeping in mind the cultural fit between their team and prospective partners. Ensuring there is a mutual understanding of what the overall vision is and how it will be achieved – including the practical implementation, timeline and costs – will establish a strong foundation for the business-to-business relationship.\r\n\r\nAligning the best technology with best practice\r\n\r\nMeaningful digital transformation is achieved when the best technology aligns with best practice. Developers must resist the urge to jump on the latest technology trends, which might, at best, increase the cost of development or, at worst, significantly set back progress.\r\n\r\nEffective innovation ultimately comes from creating a stronger value proposition for clients. If exciting new architectures or programming languages don’t achieve this, then it is best to leave them out of the equation.\r\n\r\nFintech needs to be created in modern ways, with proven foundational principles in mind. Engineers must be certain their product will remain relevant and valuable for years to come, even if they are no longer there to support it.\r\n\r\nThe end user is key\r\n\r\nThe coronavirus pandemic has made it patently clear that the most successful finance companies are those that have formed partnerships to create technology which can be used seamlessly between separate banking products and accounts. Yobota’s aforementioned research is evidence of that; banking customers are becoming increasingly frustrated with inflexible products and services.\r\n\r\nThe quality and functionality of digital solutions is going to remain of utmost importance going forward. Once people have a taste for the speed, ease and convenience of being able to manage their finance affairs digitally, they will not settle for a return to in-branch meetings, lengthy telephone calls or slow exchanges of paperwork.\r\n\r\nThat is why the voice of the customer must always drive development roadmaps. After all, the happiness of the end user is the strongest indication of success.\r\n\r\nFintechs must consider how they can deftly leverage new and advancing technology to continue to make the customer experience even better, while also improving their underlying product. Interoperability – the ease of integration with other providers – is also an important consideration to bear in mind.\r\n\r\nProgressive fintech promotes partnerships and interoperability to reduce the roadblocks that customers encounter – and it will find innovative ways to bring all of these services into one product.\r\n\r\nThe success of finance companies in the months ahead will, in no small part, be determined by their ability to keep pace with the technological change that is taking place. There is no doubt that developing fintech solutions that are fit for purpose in today’s market is a tall order, but the reward comes from seeing the difference it makes to businesses’ and consumers’ everyday']"

This means that Fintech companies, who could so far often rely on a comparatively lenient regulatory regime, will now have to give serious thoughts on compliance with applicable regulatory rules.  Operating in a highly regulated environment is tedious, but not all badcompanies that can play the regulatory game well have a strategic advantage, especially with regard to time-to-market and scaling. Nothing spells missed opportunity like a competitor building market share with a copycat product whilst you are still waiting for your license!  Written for professionals, this book helps anyone whose job has to do with formulating or executing a Fintech startup strategy or whose job touches financial services regulation, or anyone who simply wants an easy- to-read introduction to financial services and their regulation.     Describes the purpose of and principle behind modern financial services regulation  Explains how to include regulation into a startups strategic planning to optimize time-to-market and scaling  Gives an overview of the entire financial services space, and which regulations apply where  Gives detailed references to 20 key regulations in the EU regulatory system, including PSD, GDPR, CRD, AMLD, MiFID, UCITSD, AIFMD    The first part introduces financial services regulation, its purpose, how it is created (especially in the EU and in the US), and it develops a framework for including regulations into the strategic planning of a company. It also gives a rundown of the current financial services spaceplayers and productsand its key regulations. The second part describes a regulatory system in more detail. The system chosen is the EU because it is more consistent and unified than the US system where a lot of the regulation still is created at the state-level. However, as most financial regulation nowadays is determined at the global level, the principles found in EU regulation will be by and large also be found the US and other systems.']"

Montapert One Big Thing In Fintech: More than 90M millennials will soon be in what Goldman Sachs calls their “prime spending years.” Millennials have overtaken the baby boomers to become the largest generational cohort in America. In aggregate, they command $1.4T in annual spending. They have a deep antipathy to traditional financial institutions, and financial security has never been more top of mind to so many people, due in part to the economic challenges driven by the Covid-19 pandemic. A host of startups have emerged to capitalize on these trends. These companies are making it easier to make a budget, invest, and buy stocks, as well as to get loans and credit cards.

Market Moving Headline: As the new administration looked to advance the status of coronavirus relief, U.S. stock index futures established record highs. Key Takeaways: - Positive earnings revisions nearing records. - Equity mutual funds attract strong inflows. - Multi-asset funds raising equity allocations. In coming sessions, participants will want to pay attention to the $3,919.75 spike base and $3,928.25 balance-area high. Spike’s mark the beginning of a break from value. Spikes higher (lower) are validated by trade at or above (below) the spike base (i.e., the origin of the spike). In the best case, the S&P 500 opens and remains above the $3,919.75 spike base, confirming last week’s higher prices. In the worst case, the S&P 500 auctions below the $3,919.75 spike base. Trade below the spike base would be the most negative outcome and may trigger a new wave of downside discovery, repairing some of the poor structures left in the wake of the aforementioned advance.

It is easy to forget that services which now form part of the banking fabric – such as ATMs and credit cards – once represented radical innovations. Until now, technological adoption and innovation within financial services has, for the most part, been sector-led: implemented by banks or insurance companies to update and enhance existing functions and services, without challenging underlying business models. One might reasonably describe these iterations over time as an evolution.\n\nFinTech’s impact is already reverberating across all sectors that comprise the financial services market, from wealth management to microfinance. The impact is also being felt by consumers, as FinTech starts to transform their experience of and engagement with financial services.\n\nThis paper seeks to explore how and why FinTech is transforming financial services markets for consumers, and to understand what the implications – both positive and negative – are, as FinTech services and products start to become widely used. It also offers some thoughts on how those working in the consumer interest might address some of the emerging consumer protection issues.']"

fintech fight prospect,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document.html?reference=EPRS_BRI(2017)599348,3,"['FinTech, the abbreviation for financial technology, is a broad term. It is mainly used to refer to firms that use technology-based systems either to provide financial services and products directly, or to try to make the financial system more efficient. Examples include robotic trading, cashless payments, crowdfunding platforms, robo-advice, and virtual currencies. The value of global FinTech investment in 2015 grew by 75 % to US$22.3 billion. Corporates, venture capital and private equity firms have invested more than US$50 billion in almost 2 500 global FinTech start-ups since 2010.\nThe rapidly growing FinTech sector has its rewards and challenges (e.g. data and consumer protection issues, risk of exacerbating financial volatility and cybercrime) and is increasingly attracting political attention. The European Commission set up a Financial Technology Task Force (FTTF), and the European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee (ECON) presented its draft report on FinTech in January 2017. At G20 level, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) will present its study scrutinising FinTech in July 2017.\nDue to the broad scope of FinTech, regulators can face a dilemma: rule-based regulatory frameworks set out compliance obligations clearly, but these are often expensive from a start-up perspective and could be an obstacle to innovation and job creation; principle-based regulation is more flexible, but could create some uncertainty as to what exactly is expected in terms of compliance.', 'european parliament, parliament, europe']"

In understanding how blockchain can be used to create an incentive-driven, ownership economy, Benzinga chatted with Adi Sideman, founder at Props, a company creating equitable media ecosystems. About: Founded in 2017 by Sideman, most known for founding YouNow, a live streaming app that enables creators to earn money for their content, Props allows creators and valuable contributors a personal stake in the networks they build. The idea behind the company came after YouNow offered Sideman a unique perspective into the power of blockchain and utility tokens. “From our experience in sharing value in the revenue-share realm, we thought that there’s something better than just cash or capital,” the founder said in reference to a token that unlocks utility, or benefits. “It’s a scarce asset so it has the characteristics of an upside in the network, but you can provide it in a productized, gamified, and scalable fashion.” Evolution: In 2019, the company launched a main net where apps like Dating.com, and Camfrog, could partner with their users by providing utility for Props’ token, as well as rewarding users with the asset. “We have half a dozen apps that joined the network, each with millions of monthly users,” Sideman said. “We have a unique approach and, today, across these apps, there are 8 million token holders, which is significant.” After establishing proof of concept, Props successfully solicited investment from YouTuber Casey Neistat, Union Square Ventures, Comcast, Venrock, and Andreessen Horowitz’s Chris Dixon. Props is using funds to expand the depth and breadth of its platform’s functionality which allows users to earn tokens for creating and consuming content, as well as tipping. “Our thesis is that cryptocurrencies and blockchain are ushering a revolution,” Sideman noted. “99% of all apps today will want to take advantage of the power that blockchain and cryptocurrency are unleashing, but are not necessarily going to want to re-engineer their entire business model.” For those apps, Props provides solutions that look similar to a traditional loyalty program. “It works on today’s platforms -- web, Android, iOS -- and it allows these apps to effectively share or align their most valuable users with a financial asset that can provide an upside for people who add value to the network and care to hold and grow with it.” More On Workings: Props’ solution is an app-level protocol and the token is backed by the aggregate utility of millions of users. “That means that apps are effectively mining, receiving tokens from the protocol, based on the demand they are generating for the token, [and] utility value they provide.” If an app solicits poor demand, the protocol will provide little to no rewards. “Say an app is giving discounts, VIP support, and it unlocks special content or features,” Sideman said. “If a user is using the app and says it is worth $5, they may not give up all the benefits and discounts. But, for $500, they’ll sell it.” Props, simply put, makes it easy to assign and transfer valuable app benefits. Its approach is impactful; according to a Props study, when apps provide utility or some reward, users’ actions are reinforced. “You’ll create more of that activity.” Recent Developments: In 2020, Props completed financing and took steps to improve liquidity, adding GSR Markets, a crypto trading firm and liquidity provider, to provide a tight market for its token. “Over the past few weeks, our token was listed on multiple international non-U.S. exchanges, including OKEx, KuCoin, and Gate.io,” the founder said on providing access to Props’ international user base. “In the U.S., we’ve been qualified by the SEC, under Reg A+, which means that we have the unique ability to work with U.S. companies, which are generally risk-averse. They don’t want to jump into new products or technologies that may expose them.” Going Forward: Props plans to amp up its compliance efforts, as well as grow its network. “In the next two weeks, we expect to announce more partners,” Sideman said. “Throughout the year, we’ll announce tools, built around Props, that make it easy to integrate -- SaaS-like, admin, and web-view tools.” These plans come as real businesses are asking themselves how they can leverage blockchain and token technology to align with their users and enable more engaging experiences. “We’re sort of in the right place, at the right time, to be able to provide these easy-to-use solutions for traditional businesses.” See more from BenzingaClick here for options trades from BenzingaFintech Focus For March 5, 2021Fintech Focus For March 4, 2021© 2021 Benzinga.com.

fintech hit make,https://www.bobsguide.com/guide/news/2020/Dec/21/risk-rise-in-pandemic-hit-fintech-sector/,1,"['Risk rise in pandemic-hit fintech sector', '\r\n\r\nThe most immediate disruptive threat, although not the biggest, is clearly Brexit because of a welter of regulatory obligations. When UK finally and irrevocably leaves the EU on December 31, it will introduce even more complications for the finance sector\r\nin general and payment service providers (PSPs) in particular.\r\n\r\nThere’s considerable potential for disruption during the transition period in terms of processing payments as UK firms phase in regulatory changes. The authorities will be watching closely. “We expect UK PSPs to have effective risk-based procedures that apply where the transfer of payment lacks the information needed on the payer or the payee,” warns the Prudential Regulation Authority.\r\n\r\nFirms will have to be on the ball in the weeks and months after Brexit. “If any payments are disrupted, we expect firms to communicate promptly with any affected customers….and give them the opportunity to make the payment in another way,” says the PRA.\r\n\r\nBut the most pressing risk is cyber attacks. If there is one issue that strikes at the heart of all firms having custody client funds, it’s security of client’s money, identity and other personal details.\r\n\r\nAs Mastercard reports, fintech is the biggest target of cyber attacks after healthcare. And too many fintech firms are vulnerable. Research by ImmuniWeb, an application security group, has found that 98 percent of the biggest global fintech startups are vulnerable to major cyber attacks. In 2019 the industry saw a 480 percent increase in the number of cyber attacks on regulated financial services companies, according to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), most of them from phishing, ransomware and data leakage.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of attacks has forced the International Monetary Fund to conclude that they amount to a full-on threat to financial stability. “As we become increasingly reliant on digital financial services, the number of cyber attacks has tripled over the last decade, and financial services continue to be the most targeted industry. Cyber security has clearly become a threat to financial stability,” the organisation concludes in a blog in December. “Given strong financial and technological interconnections, a successful attack on a major financial institution, or on a core system or service used by many, could quickly spread through the entire financial system causing widespread disruption and loss of confidence.”\r\n\r\nAnd as the cost of hacking tools collapses and more bad actors get involved, the risks mount. “In our view many national financial systems are not yet ready to manage attacks while international coordination is still weak,” warns the IMF.\r\n\r\nBut management has not yet risen to the challenge either. The pandemic has increased cyber risk because more staff are working remotely, notes cloud security specialist Trend Micro. “Home networks, remote working software and cloud systems will be at the centre of a new wave of attacks in 2021,” it predicts in its latest report Turning the Tide. “Cyber-criminals will particularly look to home networks as a critical launch pad to compromise corporate IT and IoT networks.”\r\n\r\nThe main targets will be anybody who regularly accesses sensitive data such as sales managers holding information about customers and senior executives managing confidential company numbers. Also application programming interfaces (APIs), one of the most important tools of the fintech sector, will come under fire, predicts Trend Micro. “As third-party integrations reign, exposed APIs will become a new preferred attack vector for cyber-criminals, providing access to sensitive customer data, source code and back-end services.\r\n\r\nIn the long run artificial intelligence may come to the rescue by blocking all unauthorised access, but security experts say the looming prospect of a wave of attacks will force firms to invest heavily in training, especially of remote workers, as well as in systems that improve detection and response rates around the clock.\r\n\r\nBy common consent home working has greatly increased the risk of losing vital data. Yet, notes Ireland’s advisory and accounting firm HLB Sheehan Quinn in its 2020 cyber security report, more than half of organisations said their security procedures were not designed for remote working.\r\n\r\nSustainability \r\nA much softer but by no means insubstantial risk arises in investors’ insistence on a culture of sustainability. Put another way, firms that aren’t seen as sustainable will lose potential and actual clients.\r\n\r\nClimate-friendly behaviour is no longer optional as regulations steadily tighten, like the EU’s imminent rules on sustainable finance (SDFR). “Sustainability and responsible investment are becoming mainstream priorities for pension funds, insurers and other investors,” explains Melville Rodrigues, senior consultant for funds services in Ocorian, a specialist in fiduciary services, fund administration and capital markets, in a briefing in December. “Managers are responding with fund products that look to meet these priorities.”\r\n\r\nAnd the obligations are onerous, applying from March 2021 to all products marketed into the EU including from non-EU managers. Rodrigues adds: “The SFDR requires fund managers, such as those operating as alternative investment fund managers (AIFMs), to disclose how they have integrated in their processes, including in their due diligence, an assessment of all relevant sustainability risks that might have a material negative impact on the financial return of a fund investment.”\r\n\r\nBrexit won’t make things any easier. The UK government has already announced it will implement mandatory climate-related financial disclosures right across the economy by 2025 at the latest, but many disclosure obligations will come into force by 2023.\r\nThis is a bottom-line issue for investors who watch firms’ credentials closely. Indeed rating agency Scope has started ranking stock exchanges on the average environmental impact of their component stocks.\r\n\r\n“Our assessment of environmental, social and governance impacts acts like an early warning system for portfolio managers, showing where future regulatory risks and associated costs lie through the analysis of today’s impacts by factor, sector and geography,” said head of ESG Diane Menville in mid-December. Incidentally, also in December France’s CAC40 index scored higher than Germany’s DAX30. “In ESG impact CAC40 has a greener global footprint than DAX30,” notes Scope, putting the former at 6.5 out of a perfect 10 compared with the latter’s 6.3.\r\n\r\nLobby groups are watching too. In mid-December UK-based Make My Money Matter gave a pat on the back to the mighty New York State Pension Fund with $193.4bn under management after it promised to sell shares in companies, mainly oil and gas, by 2040 if they are still contributing to global warming. Meantime Make My Money Matter is lobbying the UK government to require all pension funds to report on their emissions projections up to 2050 and align their portfolios with the Paris Agreement.\r\n\r\nInvestment firms are rapidly waking up to the risks of climate-hostile actions. Luxembourg-based investment manager Lombard Odier is one that has committed to a “bio-friendly” philosophy built around the CLIC economy, standing for circular, lean, inclusive and clean. It’s a new world in investment, say portfolio manager Alina Donets and head of CLIC Kristina Church. “Global businesses already recognise the need for transformation toward circular and lean operating models,” they explain in a paper released in December.\r\n\r\nThis is seen as virtuous and profitable. Lombard Odier has identified 550 bio-friendly companies, mostly small and mid-cap, that offer “superior growth profiles and excess economic returns, combined with solid ESG credentials including assessment of any controversies.”\r\n\r\nFrench neo-insurer Luko could be the new model. The home insurance specialist, which has just raised €50m in a second round of funding, has grown six times since its launch in 2018 on the back of the kind of ethical behaviour that increasingly attracts customers. At the end of every financial year the insurtech, boasting 100,000 clients, hands to charities any premiums in the pool that haven’t been used to refund claims. The policyholders choose the charities.\r\n\r\nKeeping up\r\nIn a fast-developing industry based on high technology, firms that fail to keep up will suffer, for instance in cross-border payments. As the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) pointed out in a report in August, cross-border payments are generally “slower, more expensive, less transparent and less accessible than domestic payments.” Consequently, the G20 has made them a top priority and has asked the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to address systemic issues.\r\n\r\nAs a report by America’s Association for Financial Professionals makes clear, this will necessarily involve investment, planning and technology. Citing the importance of “operational improvements that can be made to domestic and international payment infrastructures,” notes the association in November, the FSB sees opportunities to reduce problems caused by different operating hours, long transaction chains, high funding costs, access regimes, and weak competition.”\r\n\r\nThe pandemic has made reforms more urgent. As the association notes, the BIS believes that the crisis has “amplified calls to reinforce coordination and reduce fragmentation in cross-border payment systems.”\r\n\r\nAnd that may increase competition in a shrunken, pandemic-hit market. As McKinsey & Co has calculated, global payments revenue will probably fall by seven per cent – equivalent to $170bn – in 2020. And the established institutions are fighting back. Working with more than 20 banks, SWIFT is expanding into lower-value transfers for SMEs and consumers with fewer friction points in what it calls “predictable payments”.\r\n\r\nIn this market there are only the quick and the']"

We start with recalling well-known (in part from school) properties of the polygonal approximation of the common circle when approximating the famous circle number    &pi;    by convergent sequences of upper and lower bounds being based upon the lengths of polygons. Next, we shortly refer to some results from the literature where suitably defined generalized circle numbers of     l p    - and     l  p , q     -circles,     &pi; p     and     &pi;  p , q     , respectively, are considered and turn afterwards over to the approximation of an     l p    -circle by a family of     l  p , q     -circles with q converging to p,     q &rarr; p    . Then we ask whether or not there holds the continuity property      &pi;  p , q   &rarr;  &pi; p   as  q &rarr; p    . The answer to this question leads us to the answer of the question stated in the paper&rsquo;s title. Presenting here for illustration true paintings instead of strong technical or mathematical drawings intends both to stimulate opening heart and senses of the reader for recognizing generalized circles in his real life and to suggest the philosophical challenge of the consequences coming out from the demonstrated non-continuity property.']"

Our results indicate a positive relationship exists between the growth in FinTech funding or deals and the contemporaneous stock returns of incumbent retail banks. Although these results suggest complementarity between FinTech and traditional banking, we note that our results at the banking industry level are not statistically significant, and that the coefficient signs for about one-third of the banks are negative, but not statistically significant. Since the FinTech industry is young and our sample period short, we cannot rule out that our findings are spurious.']"

It is mainly used to refer to firms that use technology-based systems either to provide financial services and products directly, or to try to make the financial system more efficient. Examples include robotic trading, cashless payments, crowdfunding platforms, robo-advice, and virtual currencies. The value of global FinTech investment in 2015 grew by 75 % to US$22.3 billion. Corporates, venture capital and private equity firms have invested more than US$50 billion in almost 2 500 global FinTech start-ups since 2010.\nThe rapidly growing FinTech sector has its rewards and challenges (e.g. data and consumer protection issues, risk of exacerbating financial volatility and cybercrime) and is increasingly attracting political attention. The European Commission set up a Financial Technology Task Force (FTTF), and the European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee (ECON) presented its draft report on FinTech in January 2017. At G20 level, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) will present its study scrutinising FinTech in July 2017.\nDue to the broad scope of FinTech, regulators can face a dilemma: rule-based regulatory frameworks set out compliance obligations clearly, but these are often expensive from a start-up perspective and could be an obstacle to innovation and job creation; principle-based regulation is more flexible, but could create some uncertainty as to what exactly is expected in terms of compliance.', 'european parliament, parliament, europe']"

But fintech activity is growing rapidly. Digital payment schemes are expanding within countries, although cross-border and pan-euro area instruments are not yet widespread, notwithstanding important enabling EU level regulation and the establishment of instant payments by the ECB. Automated lending models are developing but remain limited mainly to unsecured consumer lending. While start-ups are pursuing platform-based approaches under minimal regulation, there is a clear trend for fintech companies to acquire balance sheets and, relatedly, banking licenses as they expand. Meanwhile, competition is pushing many traditional banks to adopt fintech instruments, either in-house or by acquisition, thereby causing them to increasingly resemble balanced sheet-based fintech companies. These developments could improve the efficiency and reach of financial intermediation while also adding to profitability pressures for some banks. Although the COVID-19 pandemic could call into question the viability of platform-based lending fintechs funding models given that investors could face much higher  delinquencies, it may also offer growth opportunities to those fintechs that are positioned to take advantage of the ongoing structural shift in demand toward virtual finance.', 'lending,payment system,European Union,Payments Directive,PSD2,WP,Fintech company,direct debit,micro-enterprise lending,individual investor,Big-tech company,crowdfunding firm,due diligence,payment company,value chain,venture capital']"

The increased reliance on digital solutions has, in turn, opened people’s eyes to the convenience (or inconvenience) of managing their financial affairs online.\r\n\r\nYobota recently commissioned a survey of over 2,000 UK adults to explore how satisfied customers are with their banks in 2020. The majority (58 percent) said they want more power to renegotiate or change their accounts or products, with a third (33 percent) expressing frustrations at having to choose from generic, off-the-shelf financial products.\r\n\r\nDemand for greater control and more flexible, personalised products is on the rise. These demands can be met, but only if financial institutions and technology vendors are progressive in the development and application of fintech.\r\n\r\nWhether banks build it or buy it, there is a fundamental need to understand how fintech is created. And, moreover, how to do it well.\r\n\r\nAddressing the regulation barrier\r\n\r\nFinance, and by extension fintech, is a heavily regulated industry. A fintech creator’s ability to navigate the regulatory landscape and ensure it remains compliant with all the necessary checks is key to winning the confidence of the public, as well as potential clients and partners.\r\n\r\nOften, a huge volume of work is required. Rules can change over time (even temporarily, as we have seen in some cases this year), and there’s always room for interpretation in the principle-based regulatory approach.\r\n\r\nHaving a team of compliance experts on board is crucial to effectively handle any regulatory demands, particularly as the business scales – both in terms of its user base, and as it crosses borders into new regulatory environments.\r\n\r\nBusinesses must always remain forthcoming and transparent about the steps they are taking to protect the consumer, and consequently the reputation of their business partner(s).\r\n\r\nWhat problem are you solving, and who are you solving it for?\r\n\r\nIt is easy to overlook the basics when you set out to bring a new product to market and instead get bogged down in developing features. I would encourage vendors to take a step back and consider the bigger picture before delving into the technical aspects of product development.\r\n\r\nWhat challenge are you going to solve first? Is it an issue related to payment infrastructure, insurance, or investment management? Fintech is an incredibly broad industry, so it’s important to be clear on your goals. Are you going to improve or replace something that already exists, or are you looking to bring something entirely new to the market? These are all questions that should be asked in the very initial stages of development.\r\n\r\nFeatures are important, but they are often a secondary reason a customer will buy or use a product. So, it’s important that your offering provides a valuable solution to a very specific problem before worrying about the finer details.\r\n\r\nTo that end, knowing your client is crucial. Product and engineering teams need to have a clear focus as to their end goal and have a strong understanding of who they are building the product for.\r\n\r\nA technology vendor must be specific and strategic when it comes to pursuing the right clients (a particular type of financial services firm, for instance), while also keeping in mind the cultural fit between their team and prospective partners. Ensuring there is a mutual understanding of what the overall vision is and how it will be achieved – including the practical implementation, timeline and costs – will establish a strong foundation for the business-to-business relationship.\r\n\r\nAligning the best technology with best practice\r\n\r\nMeaningful digital transformation is achieved when the best technology aligns with best practice. Developers must resist the urge to jump on the latest technology trends, which might, at best, increase the cost of development or, at worst, significantly set back progress.\r\n\r\nEffective innovation ultimately comes from creating a stronger value proposition for clients. If exciting new architectures or programming languages don’t achieve this, then it is best to leave them out of the equation.\r\n\r\nFintech needs to be created in modern ways, with proven foundational principles in mind. Engineers must be certain their product will remain relevant and valuable for years to come, even if they are no longer there to support it.\r\n\r\nThe end user is key\r\n\r\nThe coronavirus pandemic has made it patently clear that the most successful finance companies are those that have formed partnerships to create technology which can be used seamlessly between separate banking products and accounts. Yobota’s aforementioned research is evidence of that; banking customers are becoming increasingly frustrated with inflexible products and services.\r\n\r\nThe quality and functionality of digital solutions is going to remain of utmost importance going forward. Once people have a taste for the speed, ease and convenience of being able to manage their finance affairs digitally, they will not settle for a return to in-branch meetings, lengthy telephone calls or slow exchanges of paperwork.\r\n\r\nThat is why the voice of the customer must always drive development roadmaps. After all, the happiness of the end user is the strongest indication of success.\r\n\r\nFintechs must consider how they can deftly leverage new and advancing technology to continue to make the customer experience even better, while also improving their underlying product. Interoperability – the ease of integration with other providers – is also an important consideration to bear in mind.\r\n\r\nProgressive fintech promotes partnerships and interoperability to reduce the roadblocks that customers encounter – and it will find innovative ways to bring all of these services into one product.\r\n\r\nThe success of finance companies in the months ahead will, in no small part, be determined by their ability to keep pace with the technological change that is taking place. There is no doubt that developing fintech solutions that are fit for purpose in today’s market is a tall order, but the reward comes from seeing the difference it makes to businesses’ and consumers’ everyday']"

Wealth managers are standing at the epicenter of a tectonic shift, as the balance of power between offering and demand undergoes a dramatic upheaval. Regulators are pushing toward a constrained offering norm while private clients and independent advisors demand a more proactive role; practitioners need examine this banking evolution in detail to understand the mechanisms at work. This book presents analysis of the current shift and offers clear insight into what happens when established economic interests collide with social transformation. Business models are changing in profound ways, and the impact reaches further than many expect; the democratization of banking is revolutionizing the wealth management industry toward more efficient and client-centric advisory processes, and keeping pace with these changes has become a survival skill for financial advisors around the world.  Social media, big data analytics and digital technology are disrupting the banking industry, which many have taken for granted as set in stone. This book shatters that assumption by illustrating the massive changes already underway, and provides thought leader insight into the changes yet to come.    Examine the depth and breadth of financial technology  Learn how regulations are driving changing business models  Discover why investors may become the price-makers  Understand the forces at work behind the rise of FinTech    Information asymmetry has dominated the banking industry for centuries, keeping the bank/investor liability neatly alignedbut this is changing, and understanding and preparing for the repercussions must be a top priority for wealth managers everywhere. Financial Innovation shows you where the bar is being re-set and gives you the insight you need to keep up.']"

fintech within establish,https://www.bobsguide.com/guide/news/2020/Dec/4/the-complexities-of-creating-fintech-and-how-to-overcome-them/,7,"['The complexities of creating fintech and how to overcome them', '\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest changes to come from the coronavirus pandemic is the effect it’s had on consumers’ expectations. The increased reliance on digital solutions has, in turn, opened people’s eyes to the convenience (or inconvenience) of managing their financial affairs online.\r\n\r\nYobota recently commissioned a survey of over 2,000 UK adults to explore how satisfied customers are with their banks in 2020. The majority (58 percent) said they want more power to renegotiate or change their accounts or products, with a third (33 percent) expressing frustrations at having to choose from generic, off-the-shelf financial products.\r\n\r\nDemand for greater control and more flexible, personalised products is on the rise. These demands can be met, but only if financial institutions and technology vendors are progressive in the development and application of fintech.\r\n\r\nWhether banks build it or buy it, there is a fundamental need to understand how fintech is created. And, moreover, how to do it well.\r\n\r\nAddressing the regulation barrier\r\n\r\nFinance, and by extension fintech, is a heavily regulated industry. A fintech creator’s ability to navigate the regulatory landscape and ensure it remains compliant with all the necessary checks is key to winning the confidence of the public, as well as potential clients and partners.\r\n\r\nOften, a huge volume of work is required. Rules can change over time (even temporarily, as we have seen in some cases this year), and there’s always room for interpretation in the principle-based regulatory approach.\r\n\r\nHaving a team of compliance experts on board is crucial to effectively handle any regulatory demands, particularly as the business scales – both in terms of its user base, and as it crosses borders into new regulatory environments.\r\n\r\nBusinesses must always remain forthcoming and transparent about the steps they are taking to protect the consumer, and consequently the reputation of their business partner(s).\r\n\r\nWhat problem are you solving, and who are you solving it for?\r\n\r\nIt is easy to overlook the basics when you set out to bring a new product to market and instead get bogged down in developing features. I would encourage vendors to take a step back and consider the bigger picture before delving into the technical aspects of product development.\r\n\r\nWhat challenge are you going to solve first? Is it an issue related to payment infrastructure, insurance, or investment management? Fintech is an incredibly broad industry, so it’s important to be clear on your goals. Are you going to improve or replace something that already exists, or are you looking to bring something entirely new to the market? These are all questions that should be asked in the very initial stages of development.\r\n\r\nFeatures are important, but they are often a secondary reason a customer will buy or use a product. So, it’s important that your offering provides a valuable solution to a very specific problem before worrying about the finer details.\r\n\r\nTo that end, knowing your client is crucial. Product and engineering teams need to have a clear focus as to their end goal and have a strong understanding of who they are building the product for.\r\n\r\nA technology vendor must be specific and strategic when it comes to pursuing the right clients (a particular type of financial services firm, for instance), while also keeping in mind the cultural fit between their team and prospective partners. Ensuring there is a mutual understanding of what the overall vision is and how it will be achieved – including the practical implementation, timeline and costs – will establish a strong foundation for the business-to-business relationship.\r\n\r\nAligning the best technology with best practice\r\n\r\nMeaningful digital transformation is achieved when the best technology aligns with best practice. Developers must resist the urge to jump on the latest technology trends, which might, at best, increase the cost of development or, at worst, significantly set back progress.\r\n\r\nEffective innovation ultimately comes from creating a stronger value proposition for clients. If exciting new architectures or programming languages don’t achieve this, then it is best to leave them out of the equation.\r\n\r\nFintech needs to be created in modern ways, with proven foundational principles in mind. Engineers must be certain their product will remain relevant and valuable for years to come, even if they are no longer there to support it.\r\n\r\nThe end user is key\r\n\r\nThe coronavirus pandemic has made it patently clear that the most successful finance companies are those that have formed partnerships to create technology which can be used seamlessly between separate banking products and accounts. Yobota’s aforementioned research is evidence of that; banking customers are becoming increasingly frustrated with inflexible products and services.\r\n\r\nThe quality and functionality of digital solutions is going to remain of utmost importance going forward. Once people have a taste for the speed, ease and convenience of being able to manage their finance affairs digitally, they will not settle for a return to in-branch meetings, lengthy telephone calls or slow exchanges of paperwork.\r\n\r\nThat is why the voice of the customer must always drive development roadmaps. After all, the happiness of the end user is the strongest indication of success.\r\n\r\nFintechs must consider how they can deftly leverage new and advancing technology to continue to make the customer experience even better, while also improving their underlying product. Interoperability – the ease of integration with other providers – is also an important consideration to bear in mind.\r\n\r\nProgressive fintech promotes partnerships and interoperability to reduce the roadblocks that customers encounter – and it will find innovative ways to bring all of these services into one product.\r\n\r\nThe success of finance companies in the months ahead will, in no small part, be determined by their ability to keep pace with the technological change that is taking place. There is no doubt that developing fintech solutions that are fit for purpose in today’s market is a tall order, but the reward comes from seeing the difference it makes to businesses’ and consumers’ everyday']"
