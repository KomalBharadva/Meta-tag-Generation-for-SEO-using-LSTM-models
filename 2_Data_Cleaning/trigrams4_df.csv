fintech card authority,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoins-biggest-fans-hedge-fund-120955652.html,10,"['(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Bitcoin is the ideal holiday gift for an underperforming hedge fund manager. Just ask SkyBridge Capital’s Anthony Scaramucci, who is diving in after his fund of hedge funds posted its worst annual performance since 2008. That’s unlikely to be a coincidence.Whatever one’s misgivings about the sustainability of the cryptocurrency’s price rally —\xa0it has doubled in one month to a $35,000 record\xa0—\xa0it’s a happier tale to tell the market than the bad structured-credit bets that saw SkyBridge clients ask for their money back. At around $40 million, this crypto\xa0bet looks like a\xa0fig leaf next to the firm’s overall assets of $7 billion, but one\xa0in tune with the times.After all, the cryptocurrency’s most vocal advocates\xa0nowadays aren’t plugged-in millennials but the hedge fund world’s baby\xa0boomers and Generation X-ers —\xa0Stanley Druckenmiller, Paul Tudor Jones — backing Bitcoin as the juice their global macro trade playbooks need. As an industry, hedge funds could use the help: While November saw them post their best collective performance for six years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, that still wasn’t enough to match returns available from benchmark equity indexes. As a specific strategy, global macro funds lagged their peer group, the stock market and the returns from the global bond market.\xa0What lures the “smart” money\xa0to Bitcoin as a trade is the very thing that makes it such a poor currency and an unreliable store of value in times of panic: It’s an illiquid, artificially scarce and volatile commodity whose price is driven by\xa0extreme sentiments of greed and fear. “Bitcoin is the perfect vehicle for exploiting mankind’s infinite stupidity,"" says\xa0Julian Rimmer, a sales trader at Investec Plc. “A small percentage of one’s portfolio must be held in this ‘asset’ because gullibility never goes out of fashion.”\xa0It could also provide\xa0a very convenient halo effect for an industry that\xa0has\xa0been shrinking for several years.\xa0Customers withdrew $50 billion last year, leaving the total amount managed at a bit less than $3.3 trillion, according to eVestment. Talking about Bitcoin as a new spin on “digital gold” hides the fact these are small, speculative bets from a sub-set of Wall Street —\xa0when Tudor Jones praised the “birthing of a store of value” last year, he also revealed that only 1% of his assets was in Bitcoin.Expectations for a tidal wave\xa0of institutional money into cryptocurrencies still look\xa0more hope than reality, therefore.\xa0Aberdeen Standard Investments’ Adam Grimsley told Financial News it was “delusional” to claim institutional investors were significantly piling into Bitcoin. As for hedge funds dedicated to trading crypto, they’re still a niche pursuit. A report\xa0by PwC found that\xa0only 35% of them manage more than $20 million, with a median size of $8.2 million. Even more telling, 90% of their clients are either family offices or high-net-worth individuals.\xa0The hope from the\xa0crypto-converted is that this will be enough to outdo day traders sitting at home speculating on stocks like Tesla Inc., which has also doubled in the space of a few months.\xa0Anything’s possible with Bitcoin, but if history is any guide, there may be tears ahead.\xa0The last time hedge funds “went crypto”\xa0in 2017 after a frothy run-up in the price, the ensuing downturn led to almost 70 specialized funds closing in 2019.Either way, Bitcoin is a Wall Streeter\'s toy right now. The early adopters sound distinctly unenthused by the rush to recreate the worst excesses of finance on the blockchain. For this price rally to keep going, it’s the 50-year-olds who have to keep buying.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Lionel Laurent is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the European Union and France.

We examine the impact of the funding of such start-ups on the stock returns of 47 incumbent US retail banks for 2010 to 2016. To capture the importance of FinTech start-ups, we use data on both the dollar-volume of funding and number of deals. We relate these to the stock returns with panel data regression methods. Our results indicate a positive relationship exists between the growth in FinTech funding or deals and the contemporaneous stock returns of incumbent retail banks. Although these results suggest complementarity between FinTech and traditional banking, we note that our results at the banking industry level are not statistically significant, and that the coefficient signs for about one-third of the banks are negative, but not statistically significant. Since the FinTech industry is young and our sample period short, we cannot rule out that our findings are spurious.']"

We examine the impact of the funding of such start-ups on the stock returns of 47 incumbent US retail banks for 2010 to 2016. To capture the importance of FinTech start-ups, we use data on both the dollar-volume of funding and number of deals. We relate these to the stock returns with panel data regression methods. Our results indicate a positive relationship exists between the growth in FinTech funding or deals and the contemporaneous stock returns of incumbent retail banks. Although these results suggest complementarity between FinTech and traditional banking, we note that our results at the banking industry level are not statistically significant, and that the coefficient signs for about one-third of the banks are negative, but not statistically significant. Since the FinTech industry is young and our sample period short, we cannot rule out that our findings are spurious.']"

fintech expert entry,https://www.bobsguide.com/guide/news/2020/Dec/4/the-complexities-of-creating-fintech-and-how-to-overcome-them/,3,"['The complexities of creating fintech and how to overcome them', '\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest changes to come from the coronavirus pandemic is the effect it’s had on consumers’ expectations. The increased reliance on digital solutions has, in turn, opened people’s eyes to the convenience (or inconvenience) of managing their financial affairs online.\r\n\r\nYobota recently commissioned a survey of over 2,000 UK adults to explore how satisfied customers are with their banks in 2020. The majority (58 percent) said they want more power to renegotiate or change their accounts or products, with a third (33 percent) expressing frustrations at having to choose from generic, off-the-shelf financial products.\r\n\r\nDemand for greater control and more flexible, personalised products is on the rise. These demands can be met, but only if financial institutions and technology vendors are progressive in the development and application of fintech.\r\n\r\nWhether banks build it or buy it, there is a fundamental need to understand how fintech is created. And, moreover, how to do it well.\r\n\r\nAddressing the regulation barrier\r\n\r\nFinance, and by extension fintech, is a heavily regulated industry. A fintech creator’s ability to navigate the regulatory landscape and ensure it remains compliant with all the necessary checks is key to winning the confidence of the public, as well as potential clients and partners.\r\n\r\nOften, a huge volume of work is required. Rules can change over time (even temporarily, as we have seen in some cases this year), and there’s always room for interpretation in the principle-based regulatory approach.\r\n\r\nHaving a team of compliance experts on board is crucial to effectively handle any regulatory demands, particularly as the business scales – both in terms of its user base, and as it crosses borders into new regulatory environments.\r\n\r\nBusinesses must always remain forthcoming and transparent about the steps they are taking to protect the consumer, and consequently the reputation of their business partner(s).\r\n\r\nWhat problem are you solving, and who are you solving it for?\r\n\r\nIt is easy to overlook the basics when you set out to bring a new product to market and instead get bogged down in developing features. I would encourage vendors to take a step back and consider the bigger picture before delving into the technical aspects of product development.\r\n\r\nWhat challenge are you going to solve first? Is it an issue related to payment infrastructure, insurance, or investment management? Fintech is an incredibly broad industry, so it’s important to be clear on your goals. Are you going to improve or replace something that already exists, or are you looking to bring something entirely new to the market? These are all questions that should be asked in the very initial stages of development.\r\n\r\nFeatures are important, but they are often a secondary reason a customer will buy or use a product. So, it’s important that your offering provides a valuable solution to a very specific problem before worrying about the finer details.\r\n\r\nTo that end, knowing your client is crucial. Product and engineering teams need to have a clear focus as to their end goal and have a strong understanding of who they are building the product for.\r\n\r\nA technology vendor must be specific and strategic when it comes to pursuing the right clients (a particular type of financial services firm, for instance), while also keeping in mind the cultural fit between their team and prospective partners. Ensuring there is a mutual understanding of what the overall vision is and how it will be achieved – including the practical implementation, timeline and costs – will establish a strong foundation for the business-to-business relationship.\r\n\r\nAligning the best technology with best practice\r\n\r\nMeaningful digital transformation is achieved when the best technology aligns with best practice. Developers must resist the urge to jump on the latest technology trends, which might, at best, increase the cost of development or, at worst, significantly set back progress.\r\n\r\nEffective innovation ultimately comes from creating a stronger value proposition for clients. If exciting new architectures or programming languages don’t achieve this, then it is best to leave them out of the equation.\r\n\r\nFintech needs to be created in modern ways, with proven foundational principles in mind. Engineers must be certain their product will remain relevant and valuable for years to come, even if they are no longer there to support it.\r\n\r\nThe end user is key\r\n\r\nThe coronavirus pandemic has made it patently clear that the most successful finance companies are those that have formed partnerships to create technology which can be used seamlessly between separate banking products and accounts. Yobota’s aforementioned research is evidence of that; banking customers are becoming increasingly frustrated with inflexible products and services.\r\n\r\nThe quality and functionality of digital solutions is going to remain of utmost importance going forward. Once people have a taste for the speed, ease and convenience of being able to manage their finance affairs digitally, they will not settle for a return to in-branch meetings, lengthy telephone calls or slow exchanges of paperwork.\r\n\r\nThat is why the voice of the customer must always drive development roadmaps. After all, the happiness of the end user is the strongest indication of success.\r\n\r\nFintechs must consider how they can deftly leverage new and advancing technology to continue to make the customer experience even better, while also improving their underlying product. Interoperability – the ease of integration with other providers – is also an important consideration to bear in mind.\r\n\r\nProgressive fintech promotes partnerships and interoperability to reduce the roadblocks that customers encounter – and it will find innovative ways to bring all of these services into one product.\r\n\r\nThe success of finance companies in the months ahead will, in no small part, be determined by their ability to keep pace with the technological change that is taking place. There is no doubt that developing fintech solutions that are fit for purpose in today’s market is a tall order, but the reward comes from seeing the difference it makes to businesses’ and consumers’ everyday']"

The increased reliance on digital solutions has, in turn, opened people’s eyes to the convenience (or inconvenience) of managing their financial affairs online.\r\n\r\nYobota recently commissioned a survey of over 2,000 UK adults to explore how satisfied customers are with their banks in 2020. The majority (58 percent) said they want more power to renegotiate or change their accounts or products, with a third (33 percent) expressing frustrations at having to choose from generic, off-the-shelf financial products.\r\n\r\nDemand for greater control and more flexible, personalised products is on the rise. These demands can be met, but only if financial institutions and technology vendors are progressive in the development and application of fintech.\r\n\r\nWhether banks build it or buy it, there is a fundamental need to understand how fintech is created. And, moreover, how to do it well.\r\n\r\nAddressing the regulation barrier\r\n\r\nFinance, and by extension fintech, is a heavily regulated industry. A fintech creator’s ability to navigate the regulatory landscape and ensure it remains compliant with all the necessary checks is key to winning the confidence of the public, as well as potential clients and partners.\r\n\r\nOften, a huge volume of work is required. Rules can change over time (even temporarily, as we have seen in some cases this year), and there’s always room for interpretation in the principle-based regulatory approach.\r\n\r\nHaving a team of compliance experts on board is crucial to effectively handle any regulatory demands, particularly as the business scales – both in terms of its user base, and as it crosses borders into new regulatory environments.\r\n\r\nBusinesses must always remain forthcoming and transparent about the steps they are taking to protect the consumer, and consequently the reputation of their business partner(s).\r\n\r\nWhat problem are you solving, and who are you solving it for?\r\n\r\nIt is easy to overlook the basics when you set out to bring a new product to market and instead get bogged down in developing features. I would encourage vendors to take a step back and consider the bigger picture before delving into the technical aspects of product development.\r\n\r\nWhat challenge are you going to solve first? Is it an issue related to payment infrastructure, insurance, or investment management? Fintech is an incredibly broad industry, so it’s important to be clear on your goals. Are you going to improve or replace something that already exists, or are you looking to bring something entirely new to the market? These are all questions that should be asked in the very initial stages of development.\r\n\r\nFeatures are important, but they are often a secondary reason a customer will buy or use a product. So, it’s important that your offering provides a valuable solution to a very specific problem before worrying about the finer details.\r\n\r\nTo that end, knowing your client is crucial. Product and engineering teams need to have a clear focus as to their end goal and have a strong understanding of who they are building the product for.\r\n\r\nA technology vendor must be specific and strategic when it comes to pursuing the right clients (a particular type of financial services firm, for instance), while also keeping in mind the cultural fit between their team and prospective partners. Ensuring there is a mutual understanding of what the overall vision is and how it will be achieved – including the practical implementation, timeline and costs – will establish a strong foundation for the business-to-business relationship.\r\n\r\nAligning the best technology with best practice\r\n\r\nMeaningful digital transformation is achieved when the best technology aligns with best practice. Developers must resist the urge to jump on the latest technology trends, which might, at best, increase the cost of development or, at worst, significantly set back progress.\r\n\r\nEffective innovation ultimately comes from creating a stronger value proposition for clients. If exciting new architectures or programming languages don’t achieve this, then it is best to leave them out of the equation.\r\n\r\nFintech needs to be created in modern ways, with proven foundational principles in mind. Engineers must be certain their product will remain relevant and valuable for years to come, even if they are no longer there to support it.\r\n\r\nThe end user is key\r\n\r\nThe coronavirus pandemic has made it patently clear that the most successful finance companies are those that have formed partnerships to create technology which can be used seamlessly between separate banking products and accounts. Yobota’s aforementioned research is evidence of that; banking customers are becoming increasingly frustrated with inflexible products and services.\r\n\r\nThe quality and functionality of digital solutions is going to remain of utmost importance going forward. Once people have a taste for the speed, ease and convenience of being able to manage their finance affairs digitally, they will not settle for a return to in-branch meetings, lengthy telephone calls or slow exchanges of paperwork.\r\n\r\nThat is why the voice of the customer must always drive development roadmaps. After all, the happiness of the end user is the strongest indication of success.\r\n\r\nFintechs must consider how they can deftly leverage new and advancing technology to continue to make the customer experience even better, while also improving their underlying product. Interoperability – the ease of integration with other providers – is also an important consideration to bear in mind.\r\n\r\nProgressive fintech promotes partnerships and interoperability to reduce the roadblocks that customers encounter – and it will find innovative ways to bring all of these services into one product.\r\n\r\nThe success of finance companies in the months ahead will, in no small part, be determined by their ability to keep pace with the technological change that is taking place. There is no doubt that developing fintech solutions that are fit for purpose in today’s market is a tall order, but the reward comes from seeing the difference it makes to businesses’ and consumers’ everyday']"

What Happened: Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (NYSE: GS) consumer banking chief Omer Ismail, along with David Stark, one of his top lieutenants at Goldman, to leads its new fintech startup, Bloomberg has reported, citing people with the knowledge of the matter. Seeking to forge a path in the financial world, the retail giant in January announced a tie-up with investment firm Ribbit Capital to offer financial services. The startup will be mostly owned by Walmart. See also: How to Buy Walmart Stock “Our customers have been clear that they want more from us in terms of financial services. This new approach will help us deliver for them in a differentiated way more quickly,” The Wall Street Journal quoted Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon as saying earlier this month. Why It Matters: For Walmart, the move marks a push against Wall Street. For Goldman, the departure of Ismail and David is a setback and comes as Goldman in recent months has seen a higher-level management shuffle at its consumer business. Ismail was with Goldman for the last 20 years and headed the Marcus consumer unit. Under his leadership, Marcus has grown into a billion-dollar business in five years. By the end of 2020, Marcus had $1.2 billion in annual revenue.

The Kalifa Review has highlighted this fact, and yet today’s Budget has offered nothing to further investment in the sector,” he said.\r\n\r\nJed Rose, general manager of EMEA at fintech Airwallex, agreed and said in a statement: “We feel that today’s Budget should have had an even greater focus on its fintech initiatives.”\r\n\r\nWith the publication of the Kalifa Review of UK Fintech on February 26, there was anticipation ahead of the Budget to see if the Chancellor would provide a plan for how the government intends to implement the review’s recommendations. Instead, the sector must wait for further news on how the government intends to proceed.\r\n\r\nRose urged the government to act quickly and develop a “unified strategy for the fintech community” to appeal to fast growth companies.\r\n\r\n“At a time when Brexit and Covid-19 have drastically altered the business landscape, the UK does not want to lose its position in the market. Fintech should continue to be a driving force for the UK by creating a global hub of quality jobs and financial inclusion,” he said.\r\n\r\nFast-track visas welcomed\r\n\r\nChristian Nentwich, CEO of fintech Duco, believes the sector is already facing an uphill struggle dealing with the fallout from Brexit, so was relieved to see that issues around access to talent were addressed in the Budget through the fast-track visa scheme for highly skilled migrants.\r\n\r\n“We have to repair some of the damage from Brexit. We just lost access to a huge talent pool where we just bring people in from Europe, so these visas that were announced looked very promising,” Nentwich says.\r\n\r\nFor companies like Duco that were scaling quickly, the current visa rules make hiring the best talent from abroad “very hard” as they can’t afford to wait up to four months for overseas hires to arrive, Nentwich says.\r\n\r\nSue Kakadia, head of immigration at accountancy firm Mazars, said in a statement that the fast-track visas would be especially welcomed in the fintech space.\r\n\r\n“The UK has a 10 percent share of the global fintech market and attracts more fintech investment than the next four European countries combined. Around 42 percent of the UK’s 76,500 fintech workers come from overseas, and the new visa rules aim to consolidate and build upon the UK’s strong position in the market,” she said.\r\n\r\nFears over capital gains tax \r\n\r\nNentwich was concerned in the run-up to the Budget that capital gains tax could be hiked to be more in line with income tax as the Chancellor sought to begin paying off some of the £407bn in borrowing caused by the pandemic. However, it has been left frozen for the time being along with income tax.\r\n\r\n“Raising it all the way to income tax levels could have choked off investments completely,” says Nentwich. “I think we have to be very careful.”\r\n\r\nThe freeze on capital gains tax has not stopped speculation over an eventual rise, particularly after the Chancellor’s stated desire to eventually balance the books in a similar vein to David Cameron’s administration’s austerity push after the global financial crisis.\r\n\r\nNentwich still expects a capital gains tax rise at some point in the near future but hopes it will be “considered” and avoid mirroring income tax – a move he says would be “disastrous”.']"

Fintech can\nsupport potential growth and poverty reduction by strengthening financial\ndevelopment, inclusion, and efficiency—but it may pose risks to consumers and\ninvestors and, more broadly, to financial stability and integrity. \nNational authorities are keen to foster fintech’s potential benefits and to mitigate its\npossible risks. Many international and regional groupings are now examining various\naspects of fintech, in line with their respective mandates. There have been calls for\ngreater international cooperation and guidance about how to address emerging issues,\nwith some also cautioning against premature policy responses. \nIn response to these calls from member countries, the IMF and the World Bank staff\nhave developed the Bali Fintech Agenda, summarized in Annex I of this paper. The\nAgenda brings together and advances key issues for policymakers and the international\ncommunity to consider as individual countries formulate their policy approaches. It\ndistills these considerations into 12 elements arising from the experiences of member\ncountries.\nThe Agenda offers a framework for the consideration of high-level issues by individual\nmember countries, including in their own domestic policy discussions. It does not\nrepresent the work program of the IMF or the World Bank, nor does it aim to provide\nspecific guidance or policy advice. The Agenda will help guide the focus of IMF and\nWorld Bank staff in their work on fintech issues within their expertise and mandate,\ninform their dialogue with national authorities, and help shape their contributions to\nthe work of the standard-setting bodies and other relevant international institutions on\nfintech issues. Implications for the work programs of the IMF and World Bank will be\ndeveloped and presented to their respective Executive Boards for guidance as the\nnature and scope of the membership’s needs––in response to the Bali Fintech\nAgenda—become clearer.', '']"

fintech law save,https://www.bobsguide.com/guide/news/2020/Sep/22/reconciliation-software-demand-shakes-up-fintech-partnership-ecosystems/,6,"['Reconciliation software demand shakes up fintech partnership ecosystems', '\r\n\r\nThe notion of reconciliation process improvement crystalises during critical periods – such as around deadlines, staff changed and new quarters - for financial reporting teams. At a certain point every up-and-coming company experiences the pains of growth and must adapt by revising its operational adequacy. With reconciliation, the breaking point usually takes place when the workload grows out of the manual framework and becomes unmanageable. Process automation shifts gears to take productivity to another level. This is imperative.\r\n\r\nOnce that’s realised, the form of ownership suitable for the company’s immediate and long-term needs as well as the allocation of project resources must be decided. It is not so much about picking the vendor, but rather choosing a model that would strike the balance between risk, costs, and benefits.\r\n\r\nInitially, many corporates consider developing a recon technology solution in-house, relying on the competences of their F&A and IT departments. However, it often becomes apparent that the make versus buy consideration is a short debate when costs and resource consumption are collated. Also, the reconciliation software market offers best practice solutions capable of meeting industry specific requirements without heavy customisation. It is the appropriate time to explore the adoption of a comprehensive reconciliation system from a technology provider.\r\n\r\nCertain industries are heavily skewed towards large volume and complex reconciliation, because that is the nature of their business. We can profile these verticals. Invariably, they handle loads of transactions and/or many counterparts and more often than not they work in the B2C or C2C arena. They sell at low margin and compensate for it with a huge number of transactions.\r\n\r\nTheir sale cycle might be relatively short and the turnover runs at a fast pace. They might be in the B2B segment for that matter, but their production flow might involve a complex network of operations with lots of suppliers, or intricate distribution networks. Banking & finance, insurance, payment & remittance services, e-commerce & retail, travel & tourism, consumer leisure & entertainment, utilities & energy, manufacturing, education, and healthcare are some of the most common examples.\r\nCompanies turn to their ERP vendor for an external recon solution. With complex data reconciliation considered a niche requirement, few ERP vendors can afford a refined module dedicated to it. Rather it is a very basic functionality for general purposes and with limited application. But a growing segment of enterprises need a reconciliation tool that would respond to their business specifics and can offer ample flexibility to match their transaction scale. ERP vendors may not have the expertise or the priority to develop a whole new embedded module by request. However, through integration with a third-party solution they can complement their offering and add value for the client segment focused on transaction processing and settlement.\r\n\r\nEnd customers are often wary of the time frames and resources required to pre-select and implement a new tool, however crucial. Through technology advisors / consultants, however, they can avail market intelligence and endorsed reconciliation solution provider shortlist. Consultants are cognisant of similar use cases and can detect patterns in their customers’ needs. They can contribute with their developed network of industry partnerships and their know-how in walking the digital transformation path. Consultancy firms can assist with different aspects of the project – gap analysis, gathering requirements, market research, leading the vendor selection process among others.\r\n\r\nPost-sale activities and the deployment of the selected platform can also be covered if consultants have the technical staff and the knowledge to conduct the implementation themselves. Implementing a reconciliation solution requires a careful survey of the current client process and the mapping of that process into an automated framework. Besides that, they can plan and execute the smooth interaction and integration with the core business management systems and the migration from the legacy system. Another important milestone is the training of the staff to take control over the new tool and reveal its full potential in order to fulfil the objectives of the transformation project. Empowering internal specialists to be self-sufficient in new processes implementation and day-to-day operations handling is a central issue here.\r\n\r\nClients with urgent reconciliation needs who willing concentrate on other aspects of their business operations can resort to professional services. Thus they would retain the ownership and the control over the recon tool, but keep its F&A team out of its daily administration and transfer those responsibilities to professional service providers. Professional services give certain operational flexibility to focus on priority tasks within the company, but also preclude staff ramp ups and narrow the core team duties to monitoring and control functions. This setup is bound by the maturity of the client organisation and its readiness to sustain a long-term tri-party relationship.\r\n\r\nOutsourcing entirely the reconciliations processes shifts the workload and the related infrastructure management outside the company’s domain. On one hand, it delegates the daily transaction matching and / or monthly account recon to professional services providers from the BPO segment and disengage the internal teams. On the other hand, it resolves painlessly the troubles with managing automated recon product and the accompanying infrastructure. It might also have sense in terms of cost and risks of adding another system to the business process management setup. Then BPO organisations are the ones to evaluate what combination of qualified delivery workforce and digital tools would produce the greatest value for their clients while keeping operational agility and cost effectiveness at check.\r\n\r\nAcquiring a reconciliation automation solution can be tailored to fit any organisation strategy. In any case, it would take burdensome manual work out of the equation and open the avenue for continuous process improvements, risk mitigation and cost reduction with exceedingly better results in terms of effectiveness. Companies affected by reconciliation process shortfalls are not alone in their quest to overhaul this often neglected sphere of accounting and financial reporting. Undoubtedly, they have the necessary tools set to do that and more than one alternative to implement it in line with their business specifics and unique']"

This study aims to identify the strategic considerations in the process of searching for FinTech investment targets. This study used a case study investigation of a top-5 bank in Taiwan. The major data sources include the meeting notes of the FinTech investment task force and interviews with the team members. Co-opetition theory was adopted as the theoretical framework and interview questions were derived from the PARTS strategies in co-petition theory. The results relate to: (1) the strategic goals of FinTech investment, (2) the added value from FinTech companies, (3) criteria in selecting candidates in the same FinTech area, (4) choosing to work as either a cooperator or a competitor, and (5) barriers from policies and regulations. This study has several findings: (1) regulations and policies shape FinTech’s development; (2) banks, technology companies, and customers are not “FinTech ready;” (3) Compare top-down with bottom up strategies; (4) banks and FinTech companies have complex relationships; (5) it is unlikely that Taiwan will produce FinTech disruptors in the near future. The findings and discussion can benefit researchers and administrators in finance-related industries. More studies are desired to observe long-term development in terms of how companies collaborate or compete in specific FinTech areas.']"

fintech social sum,https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/germany-fintech-star-falls-failure-125639677.html,7,"['(Bloomberg) -- Just a month ago, the chief executive officer of Wirecard AG boasted on Twitter that the future would still be bright for the digital payments company when “all the noise and dust settles.”At the time, Markus Braun was a paper billionaire. But over the course of a couple of days, the fintech veteran has been forced to step-down as CEO and seen the value of his stake dwindle after a two-day stock rout.Braun’s position at the German payments company became untenable after revelations on Thursday that about 1.9 billion euros ($2.1 billion) -- two-thirds of 2019 revenue and about a quarter of the firm’s consolidated balance sheet -- had gone missing. Two Asian banks that were supposed to be holding the money it denied any business relationship with Wirecard, raising fresh questions about the embattled company.After years of allegations of wrongdoing, Bruan was at the center of the controversy, with repeated assurances that Wirecard’s accounts were above the board, despite Wirecard headquarters being searched in early June by German prosecutors as part of a criminal probe involving the company’s senior management.The executive, who’s also the company’s largest shareholder, will now be replaced on an interim basis by James Freis, who was originally appointed in May to take the new role of chief compliance officer.Freis is stepping into an almost unprecedented situation. The interim CEO wasn’t supposed to join until July, when he was going to be responsible for a newly created department called “Integrity, Legal and Compliance.”Previously head of compliance at Deutsche Boerse AG, Fries held the position of director of the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, where he was responsible for the regulation of financial institutions.He will need to act fast to restore trust and reassure creditors. Failure to publish audited results on Friday triggers the potential termination of up to 2 billion euros in loans. Wirecard said it is in “constructive” talks with its banks to continue credit lines and the further business relationship.“A change in management was warranted for some time and following yesterday’s events and the further decline in Wirecard shares today, we are not surprised that the CEO is stepping down,” said Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. “There may be no quick fix.”The story of Wirecard’s woes trace back to Braun, who may have been too invested in the company, making him either unwilling or unable to see issues and take corrective measures.When Braun joined Wirecard in 2002, the payments company had a few dozen employees and in its early years serviced mainly clients active in online gambling and porn. The Austrian national since engineered a growth story by acquiring companies in the U.S. and Asia. Today, customers include Germany’s most successful soccer club Bayern Munich, French mobile phone carrier Orange SA and Swedish furniture giant Ikea.In September 2018, Wirecard replaced Commerzbank AG in Germany’s elite DAX index, making Braun a star of the country’s digital ambitions.“Markus Braun’s resignation was overdue,” said Danyal Bayaz, a lawmaker with Germany’s Greens. “Wirecard is not a small fintech, but a DAX member.”Unlike U.S. tech billionaires, Braun usually sports a suit instead of a hoodie, but generally shuns wearing a tie. He got a degree in computer science from the Technical University of Vienna and a doctorate in social and economic sciences. He worked as a management consultant at KPMG before joining Wirecard.Even after winning SoftBank Group Corp. as an investor in April last year, Braun had been unable to re-establish trust following a series of articles in early 2019 by the Financial Times about potential fraud. Despite aggressive denials and allegations of market manipulation leveled at the reporter, the company acknowledged irregularities following an independent investigation that had access only to limited information.Braun’s response to the latest crisis followed a similar pattern: downplay or dismiss the allegations, paint the company as a victim and attempt to switch over to business as usual.At 8:19 a.m. on Thursday -- a time when investors were nervously awaiting delayed 2019 financial results -- Wirecard posted on Twitter about how Chinese shopping trends were favoring its business model, sparking enraged comments as the stock collapse took shape hours later.The company was well aware of the issue at the time of the feel-good tweet. Chief Operating Officer Jan Marsalek, who has been temporarily suspended, had tried to get in touch with the two Asian banks and trustees over the past two days to recover the missing money, according to a person familiar with the matter.In the direct aftermath, Braun pointed the finger at everyone but himself.“It is currently unclear whether fraudulent transactions to the detriment of Wirecard AG have occurred,” he said in a statement on Thursday, adding that the company will file a complaint against unnamed persons. “It cannot be ruled out that Wirecard has been the victim in a substantial case of fraud,” he said later.Long-term investors criticized Braun for being too much of a “techie” -- big on vision but short on management expertise. They’ve noted that he was very loyal to employees and resisted firing people. Those characteristics could have made him too trusting to delve into compliance issues as many in charge of those areas have long histories with the CEO.Center stage is not where Braun says he’s comfortable. The computer scientist steers Wirecard from a suburban office park, a world away from the glittering urban towers that house most financial powerhouses. He calls himself shy -- his birthdate isn’t publicly known and the company only acknowledges him being born in Vienna in 1969 -- but there’s more than a hint of false modesty.He aggressively pushed the company’s expansion, executing numerous takeovers of smaller and at times intransparent operators. And he wasn’t bashful about trumping up Wirecard’s success.“It can make you stronger and more robust if you focus on the positive and manage to make something positive from negative energy,” he told Bloomberg in an interview in September 2018 with the company at its peak. “Whenever you stick your head out, some people will like it and some won’t.”A year later at banking conference in Frankfurt, the bravado was still there despite months of turmoil over accounting concerns. Sitting on stage alongside, his counterpart at Deutsche Bank AG -- a lynch pin of the German economy and a company will versed in crises -- the moderator asked both men what it meant that Wirecard’s share price was above Deutsch Bank’s, Braun replied: “It means we are both undervalued.”(Updated with additional context.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.']"
